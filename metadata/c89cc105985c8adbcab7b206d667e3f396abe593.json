Some claim this is the best sounding of the Six sources but that is debatable. The main advantage is has over the TMQ is being in stereo, but it only captures part of the performance. â€œImmigrant Songâ€, â€œHeartbreakerâ€, â€œDazed &amp; Confusedâ€, and â€œMoby Dickâ€ are missing from the main set. More significantly â€œOut On The Tilesâ€ (the first of only two known performances of the song) and â€œBlueberry Hillâ€ are missing from the encores. Also there is a big cut in â€œWhole Lotta Loveâ€ eliminating a significant section of the medley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c89cc105985c8adbcab7b206d667e3f396abe593","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1970.09.04+Inglewood%2C+LA+%28Vinyl+Version%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c89cc105985c8adbcab7b206d667e3f396abe593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,156,193,5,152,92,138,219,202,183,178,6,214,103,227,243,150,171,229,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
