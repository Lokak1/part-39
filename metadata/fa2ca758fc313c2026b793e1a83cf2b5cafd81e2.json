It tells the story (also told, with variations, \nin a novel and several operas) of Manon Lescaut, a beautiful young woman in 18th-century France who abandoned her true love, \nthe Chevalier Des Grieux, for a rich suitor's furs and jewels, suffered abuse by various men, \ntried to return to Des Grieux, and died in a penal colony (Louisiana). \nThis stunning performance was produced under Macmillan's direction at Covent Garden, \nwhere it usually draws capacity audiences (It is also in the repertoire of leading companies in Paris, \nNew York and, most recently, St. Petersburg.)\n\nBesides those two show-business staples, sex and violence, this performance offers lyric grace in the love scenes,\npathos in the death scene, remarkable dancing and mime, narrative clarity, and vivid characterization, \nnot only by Jennifer Penney (Manon), Anthony Dowell (Des Grieux), and David Wall (Lescaut), \nbut by the entire expert supporting cast and corps. --Joe McLellan \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 \nRun Time: 1:52\nchapters: 30\nresolution: 640x480\nVideo Codec: AVC/h.264\nAudio Codec: AAC \nEncoder handbrake: 0.9.4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa2ca758fc313c2026b793e1a83cf2b5cafd81e2","amp;dn":"Manon-Royal+ballet-1982%5BiPod+H264+DVDrip%5D%28with+chapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa2ca758fc313c2026b793e1a83cf2b5cafd81e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,44,167,88,252,49,60,32,38,183,147,225,168,60,242,181,202,253,129,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
