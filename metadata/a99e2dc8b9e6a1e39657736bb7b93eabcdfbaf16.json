Based on the best-selling book series, this show revolved around the lives of the Wakefield twins and their friends. Although they are absolutely identical, they have totally different personalities; Liz is everyone's best friend while Jessica is manipulative and devious. The show started out very drama-like, there was little comedic relief and dealt with serious, if not somber issues. As it progressed it took on a more lighthearted, comedic position. Although there were cast changes every season, a few stayed for all four years, including Brittany and Cynthia Daniel who played the Wakefield twins. Not only was the theme song an original song created just for the show, but the songs used throughout the episodes were too.\n\nThis is the complete series as found on YouTube. I just reformatted and merged all the episodes back into single files to make it easier for anyone wanting the series but not wanting 45+files for 22 episodes (a season). Makes it easier when dealing with HTPC's and their stacked episode naming conventions. The original videos on YouTube were not the greatest quality. Looks like they were converted from recorded VHS, but this is all i could find for a source, sorry. But hey, at least it's something and convenient. \n\nExample Quality\n(From One Episode)\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9dd0fcf4f3ddd1a9b3ad&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 18mn 1s\nBit rate : 1 057 Kbps\nWidth : 496 pixels\nHeight : 380 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nOriginal display aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.187\nStream size : 136 MiB (85%)\nWriting library : x264 core 130 r2273\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 18mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 160 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 20.6 MiB (13%)\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a99e2dc8b9e6a1e39657736bb7b93eabcdfbaf16","amp;dn":"Sweet+Valley+High+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a99e2dc8b9e6a1e39657736bb7b93eabcdfbaf16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,158,45,200,185,230,161,227,150,87,115,107,183,185,62,171,205,251,175,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
