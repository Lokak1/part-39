Her younger sister Callie comes to \nlive with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him 'dead in absentia.' As Tricia \nsifts through the wreckage and tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to \nan ominous tunnel near the house. As she begins to link it to other mysterious disappearances, \nit becomes clear that Daniel's presumed death might be anything but 'natural.'

The 720p VOD source only included 2.0 audio \nso we used the 5.1 DD from our DVDSCR source. The reason for the cut in point on the opening logo \nis because the DVDSCR didnt have the opening logo so we had to cut in that exact point to match \nthe audio. Encoded from a 720p HD wmv Digital VOD Rental. Did the usual stuff, turned out nice. \n\nEnjoy! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-50E6_4F5D313D.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-50E6_4F5D313D.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-C378_4F5D313D.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-C378_4F5D313D.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-BA02_4F5D313D.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-BA02_4F5D313D.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de5084b0b594a982153c531d0b24469a1fa7d14d","amp;dn":"Absentia+2011+HDRiP+AC3-5.1+XviD-SiC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de5084b0b594a982153c531d0b24469a1fa7d14d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,80,132,176,181,148,169,130,21,60,83,29,11,36,70,154,31,167,209,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
