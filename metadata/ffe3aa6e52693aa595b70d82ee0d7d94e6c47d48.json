He captures their leisure time, training and planning and accompanies them on an operation targeting the Afghan army.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD\n * Video Bitrate: 1808 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704x400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.76\n * Frames per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s 48000 Hz\n * Audio Languages: English, Afghanistan.\n * RunTime Per Part: 48mins\n * Part Size: 700MBs\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Subtitles: English\n * ripped by: artistharry\n * Source: DVB-rip\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan#War_in_Afghanistan_2001.E2.80.93present&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan#War_in_Afghanistan_2001.E2.80.93present&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe3aa6e52693aa595b70d82ee0d7d94e6c47d48","amp;dn":"Ch4+Dispatches+2010+Afghanistan+Behind+Enemy+Lines+PDTV+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe3aa6e52693aa595b70d82ee0d7d94e6c47d48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,227,170,110,82,105,58,165,149,183,13,130,238,13,125,148,230,196,125,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
