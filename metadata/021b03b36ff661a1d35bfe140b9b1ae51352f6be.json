The beautiful, complex images (included in full-page colour as well as black and white reproductions) serve as a rare window into the precision and exacting creativity of the Asperger mind at work.&quot; &quot;Peter Myers was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome in 1996 and his work reflects his stunning ability to plan and to organize visual information, and to embed illusions within his pictures. Peter's brief explanatory captions which accompany the images offer insight into the ways in which he composes his pictures.&quot; In the main text of the book, psychologists Simon Baron-Cohen and Sally Wheelwright discuss the work's great psychological significance, demonstrating in accessible language their groundbreaking systemizing theory of how the autistic mind processes information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:021b03b36ff661a1d35bfe140b9b1ae51352f6be","amp;dn":"AN+EXACT+MIND+by++Peter+Meyers%2C+Peter+Myers%2C+Simon+Baron-Cohen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"021b03b36ff661a1d35bfe140b9b1ae51352f6be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,27,3,179,111,246,97,161,211,91,254,20,11,155,26,229,19,82,246,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
