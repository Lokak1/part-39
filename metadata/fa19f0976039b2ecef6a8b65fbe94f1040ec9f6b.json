It's pro-active, because it not only logs, but also reacts to intrusion attempts.\n\nOnce a &quot;bad guy&quot; is recognized, he won't have access to any of your systems protected by Cyberarms IDDS. Don't give a second chance to hackers!\n\nAdditional software almost always implies additional risk. But not with Cyberarms Security Systems, as the existing system functionality of Windows is re-used.\n\nOur software uses the Windows event log for security analysis and intrusion detection (among other sources), and it configures the Windows firewall to dynamically deny access to hackers on a very low system level.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nCyberarms Intrusion Detection uses Windows standard components like the Microsoft .NET Framework, the Windows Firewall and the Windows Event Log.\n\nRequirements\n\nWindows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Small Business Server 2011, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7 or Windows 8\nAt least 20 MB free disk space\n500MHz CPU or higher\n16 MB of spare memory\nSoftware Requirements\n\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.0 (is automatically installed by our software if running setup.exe instead of the .msi file)\nThe Windows Firewall must be installed and running\nCyberarms Intrusion Detection has a very small footprint, which also makes this product one of the fastest security products with no impact on the system operations. As resource usage is extremely low, the Intrusion Detection Service can run on every Windows system listed above, including small boxes and vServers.\n\nHomepage: http://cyberarms.net/\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\nThere are 2 ways you can apply crack on this application: \n\n1) Install\n2) Rename original Licensing.Net.dll to something else\n3) Copy over cracked Licensing.Net.dll \n4) Enjoy!\n\n1) Install\n2) Run Intrusion Detection Admin\n3) Stop service by pressing pause button in the corner of the window\n4) Exit app\n5) Copy over cracked Licensing.Net.dll\n6) Enjoy!\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa19f0976039b2ecef6a8b65fbe94f1040ec9f6b","amp;dn":"Cyberarms+Intrusion+Detection+v2.1.4+%28x86-x64%29+Incl+Crack+%5BTorDi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa19f0976039b2ecef6a8b65fbe94f1040ec9f6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,25,240,151,96,57,178,236,239,106,139,101,251,233,79,16,64,236,159,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
