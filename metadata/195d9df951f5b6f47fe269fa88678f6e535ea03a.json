Featuring Graham Jarvis, Jonny Walker, Dougie Lampkin and a host of top riders.\n\nHell's Gate has been the symbol of modern extreme enduro since its first appearance an event in 2004. It pays homage to the French Gilles Lalay Classic which doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist anymore. Hell's Gate takes place every year in February, always in the International Centre of Il Ciocco, on the Tuscany Appennino in Italy. A natural paradise where you could built up all kind of tracks, included the scary one of HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gate. The Tough One Extreme Enduro in the United Kingdom is a hardcore enduro challenge that winds up and over rocky hills, boulder fields, and fellow competitors in the infamous Nantmawr Quarry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:195d9df951f5b6f47fe269fa88678f6e535ea03a","amp;dn":"Hard.Enduro.Hells.Gate.2012.SpeedHD.720P.h264.English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"195d9df951f5b6f47fe269fa88678f6e535ea03a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,93,157,249,81,245,182,244,127,226,105,250,136,103,143,110,83,94,160,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
