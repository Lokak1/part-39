Rebel Force is based on the original film and the visual editing style and plot twists laid down in &quot;The War of the Stars&quot;, the well known grindhouse adaptation. This movie aims to take the grindhouse experience to its limit, inserting all the rough edges and film breaks that you might see going to a grindhouse movie in 1970's America. It also aims to capture the low-budget problems of a grindhouse movie by using a &quot;lower tier&quot; acting talent for the voice of Darth Vader, roughly inserted into the movie. Complete with ratings warnings, special messages from the theater management and an impromptu intermission, Rebel Force is the full grindhouse experience.
