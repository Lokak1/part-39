It was released on 16 June 1997 as the first single from the album, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song's momentum built slowly in the United States throughout the latter months of 1997, ultimately leading to a CD single release on 3 March 1998, helping the song to reach number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also became famous for the legal controversy surrounding plagiarism charges. It was the 79th best selling single in the United States in 1998.\n\nRolling Stone ranked &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; as the 382nd best song of all time. In May 2007, NME magazine placed &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; at number 18 in its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever&quot;. In September 2007, a poll of 50 songwriters published in Q magazine placed &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; in a list of the &quot;Top 10 Greatest Tracks&quot;. In the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009 (an online music poll conducted by the Australian radio station Triple J) the track was voted the 14th best song of all time. Pitchfork Media's included the song at number 29 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 90s.\n\nThe music video (directed by Walter A. Stern) focuses on Ashcroft lip-synching the song while walking down a busy London pavement, refusing to change his stride or direction throughout (oblivious to what is going on around him). He repeatedly bumps into passers-by (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), narrowly avoids being hit by a car, and jumps on top of the bonnet of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to pursue and shout at him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of The Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance. \n\nUrban Hymns is the third album by English rock band The Verve, released on 29 September, 1997. It earned nearly unanimous critical praise upon its release, and went on to become the band's best-selling release and one of the biggest selling albums of the year.\n\nThe Verve were an English rock band formed in 1990 in Wigan by lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bassist Simon Jones, and drummer Peter Salisbury. Simon Tong later became a member. Beginning with a psychedelic sound indebted to shoegazing and space rock, by the mid-1990s the band had released several EPs and three albums. They also endured name and line-up changes, breakups, health problems, drug abuse and various lawsuits. Filter referred to them as &quot;one of the tightest knit, yet ultimately volatile bands in history&quot;. Their commercial breakthrough was the 1997 album Urban Hymns and their single &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, which became a worldwide hit. Soon after this commercial peak, the band broke up in April 1999, citing internal conflicts. The band's original line-up reunited in June 2007, embarking on a tour later that year and releasing the album Forth in August 2008. In 2009, the band broke up for the third time.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f2302fa609fc7b5aa7d5df740243935530c270","amp;dn":"The+Verve+-+Bittersweet+Symphony+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f2302fa609fc7b5aa7d5df740243935530c270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,242,48,47,166,9,252,123,90,167,213,223,116,2,67,147,85,48,194,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
