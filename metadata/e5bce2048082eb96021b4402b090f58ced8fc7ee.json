So you are stuck with what I could crib from other sources. If you are a Witchblade fan you will probably like this as there are significant similarities. I believe this is everything published to date.  If you are aware of anything missing please let me know.\n\nFrom Atomic Avenue:\nDerdre, a lowly maid in an Irish church, has strange dreams: she is Brigid the Protector, a wielder of magic and weapons who protects medieval Ireland from demonic invaders. The only one who gives her dreams any credence is Father Colm, a kind priest, who encourages her to explore her dreams and discover their origins. Strangely, he vanishes and is presumed dead by Derdre, but his advice is enough to send her on a journey to find out what her dreams of the Protector mean.\n\nWriter Sharon Scott and artist Steve Firchow establish a fairly solid foundation in the first issue of More Than Mortal, whichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½apparentlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Derdre is. Questions surround their young Irish heroine, and the reader is compelled to seek the answers along with her. FirchowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s artÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½while a bit on the cheesecake-sideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½moves the story along at a nice pace, but it is his work as a colorist that is particularly striking here.\nThe setting is medieval Ireland.  Our heroine is an eighteen year old woman named Derdre.  The first four books (published by Liar Comics) chronicle Derdre&amp;#039;s voyage of discovery as she learns just who she is.\n\nThanks to Sharon Scott, Steve Firchow and the scanners, uploaders and others who made this possible.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5bce2048082eb96021b4402b090f58ced8fc7ee","amp;dn":"More+than+Mortal+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5bce2048082eb96021b4402b090f58ced8fc7ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,188,226,4,128,130,235,150,2,27,68,2,176,144,245,140,237,143,199,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
