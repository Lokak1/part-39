Talking with Arkanon wasn\\&amp;#039;t fruitful.\n[20:17] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Not quite, what are you trying to achieve?\n[20:17] &lt;Abuser&gt; Make CCP confirm some things they are refusing to confirm ...\n[20:18] &lt;Abuser&gt; Make intelligent approach to fixing bugs and perfomance issues instead of messing with game balance\n[20:18] &lt;Abuser&gt; at least\n[20:18] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; You have no idea how we even work, theres 350 employees working at CCP and you don\\&amp;#039;t know the slightest about our processes.\n[20:18] &lt;Abuser&gt; I don\\&amp;#039;t know HOW you work\n[20:19] &lt;Abuser&gt; i see the RESULT of this work\n[20:19] &lt;Abuser&gt; and UNDERPANTS of it\n[20:19] &lt;Abuser&gt; I have enough experience researching MMO\\&amp;#039;s\n[20:19] &lt;Abuser&gt; eve isn\\&amp;#039;t first\n[20:19] &lt;Abuser&gt; and won\\&amp;#039;t be last\n[20:20] &lt;Abuser&gt; so if you want to tell i don\\&amp;#039;t have the understanding of CCP infrastructure related to eve - you are somewhat wrong\n[20:20] &lt;Abuser&gt; but question isn\\&amp;#039;t about this\n[20:20] &lt;Abuser&gt; from what i know previous sourcecode leak\n[20:20] &lt;Abuser&gt; was couple years ago\n[20:20] &lt;Abuser&gt; and from what i see, nothing changes in terms of quality\n[20:21] &lt;Abuser&gt; neither things, allowing people to exploit eve (for botting) - were fixed\n[20:21] &lt;Abuser&gt; is that how 350 people (i doubt if at least 1/5 - 1/7 of them are programmers)\n[20:22] &lt;Abuser&gt; work?\n[20:22] &lt;Abuser&gt; Customers without in-depth knowledge will not notice this\n[20:22] &lt;Abuser&gt; but what if somebody will explain the situation for them?\n[20:23] &lt;Abuser&gt; or you consider USD14.95 people pay you every month aren\\&amp;#039;t enough to be fair with them?\n[20:26] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; This is the wrong way to go about things and will not lead to a revolution in how CCP does things internally.\n[20:26] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Sorry if thats what you were after.\n[20:26] &lt;Abuser&gt; I\\&amp;#039;m not looking for revolution\n[20:27] &lt;Abuser&gt; Do you know such term as \\&quot;Proof of Concept\\&quot;?\n[20:27] &lt;Abuser&gt; It\\&amp;#039;s only enough it to get into hands of people who consider themselves to be programmers\n[20:28] &lt;Abuser&gt; Currently eve don\\&amp;#039;t have any clientside (and i\\&amp;#039;m 100% no serverside, except logs) routines to detect bots :)\n[20:28] &lt;Abuser&gt; Even stupid ones, using OCR and called Macroses\n[20:28] &lt;Abuser&gt; :)\n[20:29] &lt;Abuser&gt; Won\\&amp;#039;t the wave of intelligent bots make CCP work at least in the direction of securing the engine?\n[20:29] &lt;Abuser&gt; :)\n[20:29] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Of course it will, that\\&amp;#039;s obvious.\n[20:29] &lt;Abuser&gt; Nice\n[20:29] &lt;Abuser&gt; that\\&amp;#039;s at least part of the plan\n[20:29] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; If thats what you want to achieve then congratulations, we are always working on improving security and plugging holes. If you want to help with that, try a normal approach like say sending us an email with suggestions.\n[20:30] &lt;Abuser&gt; No, you are lying :)\n[20:30] &lt;Abuser&gt; Security wasn\\&amp;#039;t improved since last theft\n[20:30] &lt;Abuser&gt; except some CryptoAPI and zlib\n[20:30] &lt;Abuser&gt; so don\\&amp;#039;t try to fool me\n[20:31] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Security is always being worked on, I trust you know programming takes a lot of time and effort.\n[20:31] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; You say we have no ways to detect bots, yet we continue to ban thousands of exploiters who sell ISK and so forth.\n[20:32] &lt;Abuser&gt; And that\\&amp;#039;s all?\n[20:32] &lt;Abuser&gt; And what if people start using some hypothetic people2people trading service\n[20:33] &lt;Abuser&gt; that will avoid of using sellers who are constantly monitored via logs?\n[20:33] &lt;Abuser&gt; so there will be signle and not interconnecting trades\n[20:33] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Then we\\&amp;#039;ll pick up on that and fix it..?\n[20:33] &lt;Abuser&gt; that\\&amp;#039;s how Blizzard can\\&amp;#039;t do anything with such theme\n[20:33] &lt;Abuser&gt; don\\&amp;#039;t think you will manage\n[20:33] &lt;Abuser&gt; they are losing more than you\n[20:33] &lt;Abuser&gt; Why not to add client-side routines to detect bots?\n[20:34] &lt;Abuser&gt; Why using petitions?\n[20:34] &lt;Abuser&gt; People can lie, people can put a bucket of dirt on player who never violated eula\n[20:35] &lt;Abuser&gt; And he will be banned, if petition will contain only right details describing the things you will never log, but that are surely be bot\\&amp;#039;s actions\n[20:36] &lt;Abuser&gt; EVE Clientside is enough to put bot-detecting routines there\n[20:36] &lt;Abuser&gt; you can even use\n[20:36] &lt;Abuser&gt; your spyware approach\n[20:36] &lt;Abuser&gt; similar to when downloading PC identification python object during authentication as payload\n[20:37] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Let it all out, I\\&amp;#039;ll be sure to forward the conversation to all of our programmers, if thats what you want.\n[20:37] &lt;Abuser&gt; No, your programmers are just following the plan\n[20:37] &lt;Abuser&gt; they aren\\&amp;#039;t that bad guys who caused all this anarchy\n[20:37] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Care to tell me who did?\n[20:38] &lt;Abuser&gt; Those who plan eve development and/or who decide the priority of client upgrades to be implemented.\n[20:39] &lt;Abuser&gt; Currently Shiny Features have more priority than solidifying security and fixing bugs, from what i see\n[20:40] &lt;Abuser&gt; Or how else you can explain the ability for the bots to use same approach to exploit eve engine as when previous sourcecode leak was?\n[20:41] &lt;Abuser&gt; Nothing changed to prevent this?\n[20:41] &lt;Abuser&gt; But we\\&amp;#039;ve got tons of content patched\n[20:41] &lt;Abuser&gt; but still lagging jita and deadly lagging blobs\n[20:41] &lt;Abuser&gt; but from patchnotes i see that these things aren\\&amp;#039;t your priority\n[20:42] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; I see that your intentions are good but this isn\\&amp;#039;t playing out nicely for either parts.\n[20:43] &lt;Abuser&gt; Guys, theres no other way that will play better.\n[20:43] &lt;Abuser&gt; You simply ignore community requests to fix the core of eve, rather than add new coats to it, to make community forget about the bugs.\n[20:43] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; I despise bots and hacks over everything, but this is also a business, we\\&amp;#039;ve got developers designing content and EVE needs to grow. I know for a fact that there are programmers working on security, more than that I can\\&amp;#039;t really say.\n[20:43] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; If you think we are releasing new content to make you forget about bugs then I\\&amp;#039;m not sure what I can say to convince you.\n[20:44] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Patches have always been 50% bug fixes 50% content or so.\n[20:44] &lt;Abuser&gt; Could you certainly say me what your programmers did to secure clientside from exploiting Eve?\n[20:44] &lt;Abuser&gt; what\\&amp;#039;s certainly\n[20:45] &lt;Abuser&gt; I don\\&amp;#039;t have anything against content makers - their ideas are good, really good\n[20:45] &lt;Abuser&gt; I have full eve sourcecode, so you know what\\&amp;#039;s did, and what\\&amp;#039;s not;)\n[20:46] &lt;Abuser&gt; From all security i saw - were ROLE permissions for logins with priviliges higher than usual player, and some minor things in relation to prevent some remote service calls (some with potentially bad payload)\n[20:46] &lt;Abuser&gt; nothing else\n[20:47] &lt;Abuser&gt; is that called \\&quot;programmers working on security\\&quot;?\n[20:47] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Are you cruising for a job or something?\n[20:47] &lt;Abuser&gt; Nah\n[20:47] &lt;Abuser&gt; neither job, neither anything else\n[20:47] &lt;Abuser&gt; you may think of in such direction\n[20:48] &lt;Abuser&gt; Digging the situation to uncover the truth :)\n[20:49] &lt;Abuser&gt; You may compare me to fox mulder from x-files series\n[20:49] &lt;Abuser&gt; it\\&amp;#039;s the best description of why i do this\n[20:49] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Ah, well, nice to meet you Mr Mulder.\n[20:50] &lt;Abuser&gt; So... would you like to answer what AWESOME ccp programmers did in relation to client/server security (at least for client?)\n[20:51] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; No, we won\\&amp;#039;t respond to blackmail. If you think we don\\&amp;#039;t care or aren\\&amp;#039;t working on improving security you are sadly mistaken.\n[20:51] &lt;Abuser&gt; IA\n[20:51] &lt;Abuser&gt; did you saw the code yourself?\n[20:51] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Yeah, and?\n[20:51] &lt;Abuser&gt; or you are just telling me someone else\\&amp;#039;s words?\n[20:52] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Nop, I\\&amp;#039;m all alone.\n[20:52] &lt;Abuser&gt; And where do you see security fixes or bot catching routines in client?\n[20:52] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; I wouldn\\&amp;#039;t know, I\\&amp;#039;m not a programmer.\n[20:52] &lt;Abuser&gt; YAY\n[20:52] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; If you think we are gonna tell you everything we\\&amp;#039;ve done or are going to do then I\\&amp;#039;ve got a bridge to sell you.\n[20:53] &lt;Abuser&gt; so how you can tell if there are security pathces?\n[20:53] &lt;Abuser&gt; Morpheus, i have a client sourcecode\n[20:53] &lt;Abuser&gt; and have a people who can supply me with updates\n[20:53] &lt;Abuser&gt; of each new version\n[20:54] &lt;Abuser&gt; (where my python decompiler won\\&amp;#039;t be able to handle optimized bytecode)\n[20:54] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; There\\&amp;#039;s probably more to it than meets the eye, Fox Mulder.\n[20:54] &lt;Abuser&gt; so in relation to client i have the same about of knowledge as you\n[20:55] &lt;Abuser&gt; So you insist that security patches are applied to client and client is secure and non-exploitable?\n[20:55] &lt;Abuser&gt; Maybe i should release a small hack with portion of eve sourcecode to eve forums that will exploit something?\n[20:55] &lt;Abuser&gt; or you will continue to talk that everything is fine?\n[20:56] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Heh, I\\&amp;#039;m not saying there aren\\&amp;#039;t exploits, don\\&amp;#039;t be naive..\n[20:56] &lt;Abuser&gt; o\n[20:56] &lt;Abuser&gt; there\\&amp;#039;s 1 big exploit )\n[20:56] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; There are and probably will always be, however we will continue to work against them. What else do you want?\n[20:56] &lt;Abuser&gt; and tons of small ones\n[20:56] &lt;Abuser&gt; not the ones requiring people to do queue of actions ingame to achieve the result\n[20:57] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; And you want this fixed?\n[20:57] &lt;Abuser&gt; i\\&amp;#039;m talking about the ones, that are coming to light when you are exploiting eve python engine (oh god they said me it\\&amp;#039;s impossible)\n[20:57] &lt;Abuser&gt; Easiest way was to start using c++ and completely rewrite the code some time ago\n[20:57] &lt;Abuser&gt; but i assume it\\&amp;#039;s too late\n[20:58] &lt;Abuser&gt; so you will not get rid of python injections\n[20:58] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Time will tell, I suppose.\n[20:58] &lt;Abuser&gt; but you can think of coding anti-bot routines\n[20:58] &lt;Abuser&gt; I wonder if your programmers and qa know at least 1/20 of they ways possible to use to inject the code\n[20:59] &lt;Abuser&gt; starting from most stupid approach\n[20:59] &lt;Abuser&gt; and ending with ring0 injector\n[20:59] &lt;Abuser&gt; trust me\n[21:00] &lt;Abuser&gt; you can try\n[21:00] &lt;Abuser&gt; ugh\n[21:00] &lt;Abuser&gt; you COULD try\n[21:00] &lt;Abuser&gt; but nothing was done in this direction for years :)\n[21:00] &lt;Abuser&gt; i know people who are safely botting (first with ocr, then on python code bots) from early years of eve\n[21:01] &lt;Abuser&gt; and they also agree nothing was changed in terms to stop or make the bots function wrong\n[21:02] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; You know, if you want that to stop you should let us know exactly how those bots function instead of threatening to leak source code.\n[21:02] &lt;Abuser&gt; only if i will have public guarantess and confirmation that certain list of things will be fixed\n[21:03] &lt;Abuser&gt; confirmation on each exploit\n[21:03] &lt;Abuser&gt; otherways - there\\&amp;#039;s no sense\n[21:03] &lt;Abuser&gt; i\\&amp;#039;m not only want to see these things fixes\n[21:04] &lt;Abuser&gt; it also requires CCP to confirm that these bugs existed (and exist) over years\n[21:04] &lt;Abuser&gt; you understand what i mean\n[21:05] &lt;Abuser&gt; i\\&amp;#039;m thinking of some patching for trinity graphic engine\n[21:05] &lt;Abuser&gt; to show that it\\&amp;#039;s possible to make client show much more fps\n[21:06] &lt;Abuser&gt; at least in space, during large fights :)\n[21:06] &lt;Abuser&gt; (and that\\&amp;#039;s one more stone to the window of your programmers, who must be forgot of such thing as level of details)\n[21:07] &lt;Abuser&gt; there are many things - some interesting constants, that should be controlled by server, but they are not; ability to faster change sessions, unloading unnecessary services in runtime when they are not required\n[21:08] &lt;Abuser&gt; truth on some strange session roles like viplogin :)\n[21:08] &lt;Abuser&gt; 10 megabytes of code are enough to find a lot of things that should be there\n[21:10] &lt;Abuser&gt; *should not\n[21:11] &lt;Abuser&gt; And How these bots are functioning?\n[21:12] &lt;Abuser&gt; Executing python code inside of eve python interpreter\n[21:12] &lt;Abuser&gt; :)\n[21:12] &lt;Abuser&gt; Or calling python api (these are less intelligent ones) to call objects, methods from eve python\n[21:14] &lt;Abuser&gt; Untile eve uses python, there\\&amp;#039;s no way to prevent these bots from using it too\n[21:14] &lt;Abuser&gt; Untile=&gt;*While\n[21:15] &lt;Abuser&gt; It\\&amp;#039;s possible to catch them, but not prevent from appearing and being more and more intelligent.\n[21:15] &lt;Abuser&gt; In near perspective, other people who also have eve sourcecode (not from me) - will be able to release the bot that will be able to keep in control every single in-game activity usual player can do ingame.\n[21:16] &lt;Abuser&gt; So only way (if you are not going to stop using python) - is to implement a bot catching routines on clientside\n[21:22] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Well, thanks for all the advice.\n[21:23] &lt;Abuser&gt; so\n[21:23] &lt;Abuser&gt; i assume there will be no public excuse and to do list of bugs to fix from CCP?\n[21:27] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Not quite, however, we are prepared to talk if you want your EVE Accounts reopened. This would also be a chance for you to give and receive feedback on the horrible bugs and exploits you know about.\n[21:27] &lt;Abuser&gt; I\\&amp;#039;m not interested in my eve accounts\n[21:27] &lt;Abuser&gt; The ones you closed\n[21:27] &lt;Abuser&gt; weren\\&amp;#039;t involved in testing :)\n[21:27] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Then we have nothing more to discuss, thank you for your time and have a good day.\n[21:32] &lt;Abuser&gt; It\\&amp;#039;s was nice you agreed to talk with me.\n[21:32] &lt;Abuser&gt; Personal thanks for your patience, Morpheus.\n[21:32] &lt;Abuser&gt; Have a good day.\n[21:32] &lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Sure thing. Farewell.\n\n&lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Hi, give me a few minutes to reply to your mail.\n&lt;Abuser&gt; Sure\n&lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Do you have a list of bugs and exploits, the ones that you want us to fix?\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 1. List of exploitable clientside things.\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 2. Description of ways to exploit python engine (with examples)\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 3. Ways to detect the bot(-s)\n&lt;Abuser&gt; but\n&lt;Abuser&gt; only in case terms i listed during our last discussion yesterday\n&lt;Abuser&gt; *case of accepting\n&lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Can you list them again please so I can run this by some people?\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 1. List of places in clientside code that allows to code small client-side hacks.\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 2. Descriptions of the ways to intrude in EVE python engine and execute arbitary code there\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 3. Ways to detect existing bot(-s) (at least know 1 serious enough)\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 4. General ideas to improve EULA.\n&lt;Abuser&gt; Only when:\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 1. CCP published press release with:\n&lt;Abuser&gt; a) confirmation of some bugs/holes existed for years\n&lt;Abuser&gt; or\n&lt;Abuser&gt; b) publishes in-depth reports on these bugs, and reports on what fixes were made for them\n&lt;Abuser&gt; 2. CCP starts work in direction of serverside+clienside bot detection routines, also with public press releases (less detailed ofc)\n&lt;Abuser&gt; That\\&amp;#039;s all.\n&lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Alright, give me a few please.\n&lt;Abuser&gt; Sure.\n&lt;[IA]Morpheus&gt; Going to forward this to someone who can make a decision.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:683421fca86ff9acbe72bc81448cef1121eadcc3","amp;dn":"Eve+Online+Source%28client+side%29+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"683421fca86ff9acbe72bc81448cef1121eadcc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,52,33,252,168,111,249,172,190,114,188,129,68,140,239,17,33,234,220,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
