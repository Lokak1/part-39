Written by Bruce Bedford; Full-cast dramatisation starring Richard Greenwood, Crawford Logan and Martin Walsh.\n\nIn 1911, as a prelude to Captain Scott's ill-fated expedition to the South Pole, three men set off in the darkness of the Antarctic winter from Scott's over-wintering hut, to secure examples of the eggs of the Emperor Penguin. With temperatures of minus 60 or 70; hurricanes stuffed with snow, and a lack of fuel to thaw the food, their survival can only be described as astonishing courage and, in the end, willpower.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42b4765b19ba85ad0a8af6ca7c1430d189deb51","amp;dn":"Bruce+Bedford+-+Black+Ice+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42b4765b19ba85ad0a8af6ca7c1430d189deb51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,43,71,101,177,155,168,90,208,168,175,108,167,193,67,13,24,157,235,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
