Still, nothing stops him when the vacation bug hits. This time, he's chosen Las Vegas, the new family entertainment capital of America! Chevy Chase returns as bubbly, bumbling Clark in Vegas Vacation, a jokers-are-wild laugh fest including two other stars from past Vacations. Beverly D'Angelo is back as wife Ellen, doting on the guy she calls &quot;Sparky,&quot; and Randy Quaid again delights as grubby goof ball Cousin Eddie. Ethan Embry (That Thing You Do!) and screen-debuting Marisol Nichols are Griswold teens who love the round-the-clock nightlife - as long as they don't share it with Mom and Dad! From Seigfried and Roy's extravaganza to a Hoover Dam tour, from cruising to losing (Wallace Shawn as a shifty blackjack dealer) to amorous crooning (Wayne Newton falls for Ellen): watch Clark try to keep family and wallet together!\n\nStars: Stars:Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo and Randy Quaid\n\n\n\nScreen\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64246507503951358125.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64246507503951358125.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n              d  oooooo  u   u     d  eeeee\n              d  o    o  u   u     d  e\n              d  o    o  u   u     d  e\n              d  o    o  u   u     d  eeeee\n              d  o    o  u   u     d  e\n          ddddd  o    o  u   u  dddd  e\n          d   d  o    o  u   u  d  d  e \n          d   d  o    o  u   u  d  d  e\n          ddddd  oooooo  uuuuu  dddd  eeeee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f9665d7dbe40cbc0af9ef9ff7bed2a7e2e040b0","amp;dn":"Vegas.Vacation.1997.DVDRip.doude422","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f9665d7dbe40cbc0af9ef9ff7bed2a7e2e040b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,150,101,215,219,228,12,188,10,249,239,159,247,190,210,167,226,224,64,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
