While in Dino Autopsy we get under the skin of a dinosaur with exclusive access to the excavation of one of the most intact dinosaur mummies ever found.\n\nIn Dino Death Trap, an extraordinary dinosaur find follows a team of palaeontologists in western China as they unearth a virtual black hole in dinosaur evolution. Led by Dr James Clark of George Washington University and Dr Xu Xing of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the team uncovers hundreds of exceptionally preserved dinosaur fossils, including new species that were astonishingly found stacked on top of one another in pits of death in the dry and desolate Junggar Basin. Preserved for 160 million years, a total of 400 specimens and around 40 different species, including bizarre ancestors of the T-Rex and the triceratops and an ancient crocodilian, were discovered in the pits. The scientists believe they may even have found the elusive ?missing link? in the middle Jurassic, when dinosaur evolution went wild. Watch in awe as the amazing creatures are digitally brought back to life and we probe the mystery of how these dinosaurs lived and died.\n\nNG Dino Autopsy coming soon :rolleyes:.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.3\nVideo Bitrate: 2062 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x432\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.593:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 47:27.560\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 746MB\nSubtitles: No subs\nRipped by: jvt40\nwww mvgroup org avi\n\nRelease Notes\n\nOne &quot;glitch&quot; on the film .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef794e26e6c3589978504e2f9f1682d3163561c8","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Dino+Death+Trap+DVB+XviD+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef794e26e6c3589978504e2f9f1682d3163561c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,121,78,38,230,195,88,153,120,80,78,47,159,22,130,211,22,53,97,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
