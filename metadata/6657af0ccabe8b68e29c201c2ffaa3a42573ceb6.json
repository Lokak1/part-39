A new literary classic, Second Nature has become a manifesto not just for gardeners but for environmentalists everywhere. Ã¯Â¿Â½As delicious a meditation on one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationships with the Earth as any you are likely to come uponÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The New York Times Book Review), Second Nature captures the rhythms of our everyday engagement with the outdoors in all its glory and exasperation. With chapters ranging from a reconsideration of the Great American Lawn, a dispatch from one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war with a woodchuck, to an essay about the sexual politics of roses, Pollan has created a passionate and eloquent argument for reconceiving our relationship with nature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6657af0ccabe8b68e29c201c2ffaa3a42573ceb6","amp;dn":"Second+Nature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6657af0ccabe8b68e29c201c2ffaa3a42573ceb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,87,175,12,202,190,139,104,226,156,32,28,47,250,163,164,37,115,206,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
