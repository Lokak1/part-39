For fifty years the Holy Empire of Mann, an empire and religion born from a nihilistic urban cult, has been conquering nation after nation. Their leader, Holy Matriarch Sasheen, ruthlessly maintains control through her Diplomats, priests trained as subtle predators.\n\nThe Mercian Free Ports are the only confederacy yet to fall. Their only land link to the southern continent, a narrow isthmus known as the Lansway, is protected by the great walls of Bar-Khos. For ten years now, the city has been besieged by the Imperial Fourth Army. It is only a matter of time before it falls.\n\nAsh is a member of a sect known as RÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½shun, assassins who offer protection through the threat of vendetta. He is a man still haunted after many years by the death of his son. Forced by his ailing health to take on an apprentice, he chooses Nico, a young man living in the besieged city of Bar-Khos, whose own father is long gone, a deserter of his family. At the time, Nico is hungry, desperate, and alone in a city that finds itself teetering on the brink.\n\nWhen the Holy MatriarchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son murders a woman under the protection of the RÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½shun, he forces the sect to seek his life in retribution. As Ash and his young apprentice set out to fulfil the vendetta, their journey takes them into the heart of the conflict between the Empire and the Free Ports ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ into bloodshed and death.\n\n\n\nFormats - MOBI,EPUB,LIT\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf1256a7ae92160d461ddad98f7a0b8925e99ed","amp;dn":"Col+Buchanan+-+%5BHeart+of+the+World+01%5D+-+Farlander+%28Fantasy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf1256a7ae92160d461ddad98f7a0b8925e99ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,241,37,106,122,233,33,96,212,97,221,173,152,247,160,184,146,94,153,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
