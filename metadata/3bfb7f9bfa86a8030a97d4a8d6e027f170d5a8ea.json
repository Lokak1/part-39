You can select which\nones you want to download if you use for example the\nAzureus 2.5.0.4 bittorrent client: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://azureus.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://azureus.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can watch these movies on your computer if you use for example the\nDVD viewing program called &quot;VLC&quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis DVD is a part of the ten-DVD box called &quot;The Ultimate Matrix Collection&quot;\nthat was sold in late 2004. When you download one of the ten DVD:s you can\neither burn the resulting file with for example Nero, or mount it with\nfor example Daemon Tools and play it with for example VLC.\n\nI used DVD Decrypter to rip the DVD:s. I chose to do it in uncompressed mode\n(DVD9). The files are therefore larger than usual, but the movies also have\ntheir quality intact compared to the original. They won't fit on a single\nlayer DVDR, but will fit on a double layer DVDR. If someone would like to\nfit them on single layer DVDR:s, that someone could simply compress the\nfiles even further using for example DVD Decrypter.\n\nThe whole set of DVD:s takes about 64 GiB.\n\nIn the directory of the first DVD I have included pictures of the DVD-box\nitself and of the little &quot;manual&quot; that came along. I also photographed the\nDVD:s themselves if someone would fancy that :).\nHowever the box I borrowed from my friend didn't contain the &quot;script&quot; for the\nmovies. So if someone buys the collection box that contains the scripts and\nhas a digital camera, I would be very happy if that person would be nice and\nrelease the photos. I would like to read the script too. The movies are\nreally that great! Enjoy and share with your friends and neighbours!\n\nIf you like the movies you can thank the Wachowski brothers by sending them\na gift or postcard or something. It is they who are the brains behind these\nmovies. Don't reward the company Warnerbros. They already have enough money.\nReward Larry and Andy. I don't have their addresses but here are their IMDB\nlinks:\n\nLarry:\nhttp://imdb.com/name/nm0905154/\nAndy:\nhttp://imdb.com/name/nm0905152/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd for those that really liked the Matrix movies would probably like their\nnext movie called &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; too: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0434409/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0434409/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere should be some DVD:s of that movie on thepiratebay.se too.\nAt the time of this writing, this torrent is alive and seeded: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3507770/V_For_Vendetta_2005_NORDiC_PAL_DVDR_-_NORDiQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3507770/V_For_Vendetta_2005_NORDiC_PAL_DVDR_-_NORDiQ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRegards Tommy\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bfb7f9bfa86a8030a97d4a8d6e027f170d5a8ea","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+Ultimate+Collection+%2810+DVD9%29+%28http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bfb7f9bfa86a8030a97d4a8d6e027f170d5a8ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,251,127,155,250,134,168,3,10,151,212,168,214,224,39,241,112,213,168,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
