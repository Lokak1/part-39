While difficulties with funding means that the large new aircraft programs of the Cold War era are likely to remain things of the past, military aviation in Russia is not standing still. Upgrades to existing programs and reorganization of current resources are two of the ways in which combat capability is being not just maintained but enhanced. This volume looks at programs like the new Mi-8MTKO and Mi-24PN night-capable helicopters from Mil. The latest Sukhoi upgrades such as the Su-24M2, Su-25SM, and Su-27SM are also explored, along with the programs designed to extend the capabilties of the Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers by allowing for the carriage of new and more capable missiles. The revamping of the Russian Air Force's training fleet with the Yakovlev's Yak-130 is also considered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7d1cdcc99a4d34f68b86a054c1f85c5eaeaaac","amp;dn":"Russia%5C%27s+Military+Aircraft+in+the+21st+Century%28amitks93%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff7d1cdcc99a4d34f68b86a054c1f85c5eaeaaac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,125,28,220,201,154,77,52,246,139,134,160,84,193,248,92,94,174,170,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
