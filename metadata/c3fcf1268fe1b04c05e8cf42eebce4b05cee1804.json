But when an airliner en route from L.A. to Sydney vanishes in the same location, Kai is the first to realize that a mysterious explosion has unleashed a series of massive waves destined to obliterate Hawaii. In just one hour, Kai will lose all he has ever knownÃ¢â‚¬â€including his wife and daughterÃ¢â‚¬â€ unless he can save them from natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most destructive force.\n\nepub and mobi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3fcf1268fe1b04c05e8cf42eebce4b05cee1804","amp;dn":"Rogue+Wave+By+Boyd+Morrison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3fcf1268fe1b04c05e8cf42eebce4b05cee1804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,252,241,38,143,225,176,76,5,232,207,66,238,188,228,176,92,238,24,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
