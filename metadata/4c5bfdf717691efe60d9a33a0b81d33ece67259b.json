Ice Trail is a spin-off manga concerning Gray.\n\nBoth were written under Mashima's supervision, but while Mashima personally draws Zero himself, his executive assistant Shirato Yuusuke is the artist behind Ice Trail. Both are therefore official canon. Also published in the magazine are two special art pieces of Natsu and Igneel, which we have included as part of the first chapter.\n\nBoth of these series are monthlies and we will continue to cover them as they come out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c5bfdf717691efe60d9a33a0b81d33ece67259b","amp;dn":"Fairy+Tail+Ice+Trail+002+%5BMangaStream%5D+%5BJRR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c5bfdf717691efe60d9a33a0b81d33ece67259b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,91,253,247,23,105,30,254,96,217,163,58,11,129,211,62,206,103,37,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
