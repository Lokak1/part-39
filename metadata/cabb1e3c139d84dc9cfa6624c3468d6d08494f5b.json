Aside from Stiv, the band features Danny Nordahl who was also bass player in The Throbs.\n\nGood mix of old and new songs from all parts of Stiv&amp;#039;s career (aside from Lords of the New Church, but he was probably still smarting from their ill-hatched plan to sack him as lead singer . . . ) - some Dead Boys classics, some solo stuff, a track from the Wanderers LP and a couple of newies that he still hadn&amp;#039;t released when he died.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cabb1e3c139d84dc9cfa6624c3468d6d08494f5b","amp;dn":"Stiv+Bators+-+Live+at+the+Limelight+1988+-+Dead+Boys%2C+Lords+of+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cabb1e3c139d84dc9cfa6624c3468d6d08494f5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,187,30,60,19,157,132,220,156,250,102,36,195,70,141,109,8,73,79,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
