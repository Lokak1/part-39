It replace the .NFO.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s formated so that players (software and consumer \nelectronics) can use that information(metadata) and\ndisplay it on the screen.\n\nThe .TXT was made from the .MIS text file as the source. \nI only created it to post on sites. Otherwise, I don&amp;#039;t \nuse it.\n\n******************************************************\n\nINFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B6 is free. It&amp;#039;s the app&amp;#039;s that I \nused to create the .MIS.
