The Drifters are part of an even more exclusive fraternity, as a group that managed to carve out a place for themselves in the R&amp;B firmament and also define that music, not only at its inception as a national chart phenomenon in the early '50s but also in the decade that followed. Their place in history is as complex as their role in it, by virtue of the fact that there are two distinct phases to their music and the continuity of their membership, and their extraordinary longevity -- only the Platters could claim as great a span of years as an active recording unit, though the latter group, due to major differences in the way they were organized, were far more stable in their membership and output. The Drifters can also claim a unique place in popular music history, as a major R&amp;B group founded at the instigation of a record-label chief.\n\nTheir story began in early 1953, when Clyde McPhatter, the soaring high-tenor lead singer in the Dominoes, a vocal quintet formed by Billy Ward three years earlier, quit that group. The Dominoes were playing a scheduled gig at the New York club Birdland, one of their first performances without McPhatter, when one of the audience members present asked after the singer backstage. That fan was Ahmet Ertegun, a one-time record collector who had started Atlantic Records in the late '40s; as soon as he learned of McPhatter's having left the Dominoes, he contacted the singer and signed him to Atlantic.\n\nIt was Ertegun who gave McPhatter the impetus, as part of his contract, to start a group of his own, which came to be called the Drifters. The origins of the name and credit for thinking of it are obscure, although no one at Atlantic liked &quot;the Drifters&quot; at first, thinking it sounded too country &amp; western -- the explanation sometimes offered by those present was that the members simply drifted in from other groups.\n\n....\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kifexqe5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kifexqe5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nIf Rhino's Very Best of the Drifters is a fine R&amp;B snack, then All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More: 1959-1965 is a three-course gourmet meal with dessert built on the same ingredients. Forget about the higher price and the fact that 40 songs might seem to be more Drifters than most casual listeners would want -- All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More: 1959-1965 is a towering and magnificent collection of some of the best popular R&amp;B ever done this side of Sam Cooke. And, as with Sam Cooke, the beautiful part of the Drifters' work during this period is that any look beyond and behind their hits reveals a lot more songs that were every bit as good as those hits. There's not even a slightly weak track anywhere on All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More, which contains the biggest hits Ben E. King, Rudy Lewis, and Johnny Moore sang for the group. &quot;There Goes My Baby,&quot; &quot;This Magic Moment,&quot; &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me,&quot; &quot;Sweets for My Sweet,&quot; &quot;I Count the Tears,&quot; &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful,&quot; &quot;Up on the Roof,&quot; &quot;On Broadway,&quot; and &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; are all here, mastered in surprisingly good sound for the late '80s. There's a lot more than that, however -- the producers have also included killer B-sides (such as &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;) that hadn't been in print since the mid-'60s, and they've dug even deeper to throw in finished tracks that were left in the vaults until the '70s. The notes by Colin Escott are an added bonus, displaying his usual command for historical detail.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0ifexqt5ldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0ifexqt5ldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002INL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002INL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
