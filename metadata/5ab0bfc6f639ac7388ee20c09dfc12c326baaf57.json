With love and reverence we worship Him, and in fear and longing we invoke His name. I testify that Muhammad is his servant, Prophet, His own beloved, best chosen and most trusted for His revelation, was sent down by Allah to save the human soul from self-indulgence and degradation, connecting it to the one who created the heavens and the earth. He was, by all means, a role model, and his message was a mercy and guidance for all mankind, giving them glad tidings and saving them from oppression. Peace and blessings be upon him.\n\n\nAddress: Women in Islam\nLanguage: English\nFormat: PDF\nPages:  53\nFormation : Aisha Lemu - Fatima Heeren\nReviewing : Muhammad AbdulRaoof\n\nShort Description: This book discusses the special place women have in the religion of Islam and seeks to address some of the many misconceptions and false propaganda published by those who are ignorant of this religion or harbor a malicious intent to purposely misrepresent this religion.\n\n                       Hope you Gain Islamic Knowledge!!\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab0bfc6f639ac7388ee20c09dfc12c326baaf57","amp;dn":"Women+of+Islam+-+Behind+the+Veil+%5BYusef+Estes%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab0bfc6f639ac7388ee20c09dfc12c326baaf57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,176,191,198,246,57,172,115,136,238,32,192,157,252,18,195,38,186,175,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
