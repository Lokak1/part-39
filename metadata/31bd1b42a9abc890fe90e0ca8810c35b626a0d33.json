The series first aired in October 1997 on Fox Kids in the United States and YTV in Canada, producing 24 episodes and winning the 1998 Gemini Award for &quot;Best Animated Series&quot; before it was canceled in April 1998.[1] With the exception of the first and last episodes, which each had a running time of about 20 minutes, each episode was approximately 10 minutes in length, and were usually aired in pairs.\n\nThe series revolves around the freelance police accepting missions from the mysterious Commissioner, whom they have never seen. The assignments usually lead them into far-off and exotic locales such as the Moon, Mount Olympus, the center of the Earth or the mutant inhabited waters of Bohunk Lagoon. In between these assignments, the pair also manage to squeeze in fridge-spelunking, time-travelling, Bigfoot-hunting and numerous other escapades. There were also holiday themed episodes, such as visiting a prison on Christmas and delivering an artificial heart on Valentine's Day.\n\n\n\nEpisode 01 - &quot;The Thing That Wouldn't Stop It&quot;\t\nEpisode 02 - &quot;The Second Show Ever&quot; - &quot;Max's Big Day&quot;\nEpisode 03 - &quot;Bad Day on the Moon&quot; - &quot;They Came from Down There&quot;\nEpisode 04 - &quot;The Friend for Life&quot; - &quot;Dysfunction of the Gods&quot;\nEpisode 05 - &quot;Big Trouble at the Earth's Core&quot; - &quot;A Glitch in Time&quot;\nEpisode 06 - &quot;That Darn Gator&quot; - &quot;We Drop at Dawn&quot;\nEpisode 07 - &quot;Christmas Bloody Christmas&quot; - &quot;It's Dangly Deever Time&quot;\nEpisode 08 - &quot;Aaiiieee Robot&quot; - &quot;The Glazed McGuffin Affair&quot;\nEpisode 09 - &quot;The Tell Tale Tail&quot; - &quot;The Trouble with Gary&quot;\nEpisode 10 - &quot;Tonight We Love&quot; - &quot;The Invaders&quot;\nEpisode 11 - &quot;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang&quot; - &quot;Little Bigfoot&quot;\nEpisode 12 - &quot;Fools Die on Friday&quot; - &quot;Sam &amp; Max vs. the Uglions&quot;\nEpisode 13 - &quot;The Final Episode&quot;\n\n\nSpecs:\n\nFormat: .MKV\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x480 (319:240) 29.97fps [English (Video 1)]\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo [English (Audio 1)]\nAudio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo [English (Audio 2)]\n\nEpisode file names formatted for XBMC.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31bd1b42a9abc890fe90e0ca8810c35b626a0d33","amp;dn":"Sam+and+Max+Complete+Series+-+MKV+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31bd1b42a9abc890fe90e0ca8810c35b626a0d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,189,27,66,169,171,200,144,254,144,224,202,136,16,195,91,98,106,13,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
