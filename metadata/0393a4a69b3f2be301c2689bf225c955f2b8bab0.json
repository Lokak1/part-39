A successful but severely alcoholic poet befriends a single mother who works at a children's school during the day, but picks up extra cash at night as a call girl. Other characters include a former soccer player trying to find success in big business while staying true to his wife, the retired athlete's cynical mentor, and the parents of the teacher who are unaware of their daughter's moonlighting activities. Life In a Fishbowl screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage: Icelandic\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0393a4a69b3f2be301c2689bf225c955f2b8bab0","amp;dn":"Vonarstraeti+aka+Life+in+a+Fishbowl+2014+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0393a4a69b3f2be301c2689bf225c955f2b8bab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,147,164,166,155,63,43,227,1,194,104,155,242,37,201,85,242,184,186,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
