Pretty dark and, uhh, 'weird', considering the time they were published. I didn't read every story in all four issues, but I genuinely enjoyed the few I did read. \n\nThe books themselves are of decent enough quality. A few dark pages here and there, but good solid lines and nice definition between the greys and blacks. I tried a 'Restore' on the first two but it didn't do much other than make the files larger, so I left them as is.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc39c304b37a543a4413dbbd7f8ca892d76e0d8","amp;dn":"Weird+Vampire+Tales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc39c304b37a543a4413dbbd7f8ca892d76e0d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,195,156,48,75,55,165,67,164,65,61,187,215,248,202,137,45,118,224,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
