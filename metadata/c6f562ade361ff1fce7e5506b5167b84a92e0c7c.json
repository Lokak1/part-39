The impact of computer-assisted surgery on a wide range of surgical procedures is clearly explained. Procedures considered include total knee arthroplasty, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, cruciate ligament reconstruction, patellofemoral arthroplasty, and revision surgery. In each case, technical aspects are thoroughly addressed in a readily understandable manner. Knee Surgery Using Computer-Assisted Surgery and Robotics will be an ideal guide to this exciting field for both novice and more experienced surgeons who treat knee injuries and disorders.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9783642314292.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9783642314292.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f562ade361ff1fce7e5506b5167b84a92e0c7c","amp;dn":"Knee+Surgery+using+Computer+Assisted+Surgery+and+Robotics+prabhu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f562ade361ff1fce7e5506b5167b84a92e0c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,245,98,173,227,97,255,31,206,126,85,6,181,22,123,132,169,46,12,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
