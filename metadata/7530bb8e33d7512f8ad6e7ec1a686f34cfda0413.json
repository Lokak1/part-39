In the United Kingdom, the album is titled Guilty Too. It is the follow-up to Streisand's 1980 album, Guilty, which also featured Barry Gibb. The album features a cover of Gibb's late brother Andy's song &quot;(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away&quot;. \nIn the United States the album peaked at no. 5 and has been certified Gold (500,000 copies sold) continuing Streisand's record of achieving the most gold and platinum records for a female artist, and in second place in general behind Elvis Presley. The album was also top 3 in the UK, where it has been certified Platinum (over 300,000 copies sold).\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide  - Guilty Pleasures isn't simply the belated sequel to Guilty, Barbra Streisand's 1980 collaboration with Barry Gibb. It's the best mainstream pop album she's made since that multi-platinum, chart-topping hit. Of course, the competition isn't exactly stiff -- her pop albums since then have been deliberately safe, overly calculated adult contemporary affairs that only made records of standards like 1985's The Broadway Album shine all the brighter -- and it, like its predecessor, is a bit of an anomaly in Streisand's catalog, since it shares more musical similarities with Barry Gibb's work than Barbra's own, yet there's no denying that this is the most satisfying straight-up pop album she's cut since Guilty. In fact, apart from the crystal-clear, overly clean digital production that immediately pegs it as a 2005 release, Guilty Pleasures could be taken as a bunch of outtakes from the 1980 album. Gibb, who wrote (along with a handful of other collaborators) and produced (along with John Merchant) the entire album, along with playing guitar and providing backup vocals, not only doesn't attempt to update his signature sound, but proudly sticks to unfashionable pop styles like the early-'80s anthemic soft rock of &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land,&quot; the mellow Latin-tinged &quot;Hideaway,&quot; and the disco of &quot;Night of My Life.&quot; Yet instead of sounding like the work of a duo stuck in the past, Guilty Pleasures sounds as if Gibb has constructed a set of 11 songs that play to his strengths as a pop craftsman and Streisand's strengths as an interpreter. This may be firmly within both of their comfort zones, but despite the record's decidedly low-key vibe, neither Barry nor Barbra sound lazy, nor do they sound like they have something to prove, as if they're consciously trying to live up to the standard their first collaboration set. They sound relaxed and quietly assured, which makes this album far more charming than it might initially appear to be. Not everything works -- some of the ballads toward the end of the record are a little too hazy and samey to catch hold -- but most of the album holds its own with Guilty, which means this is not only a pleasant surprise, but one of Barbra's best straight-up mainstream pop records, and an album that surely lives up to its title.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Come Tomorrow\t&gt; Barbra Streisand &amp; Barry Gibb\n[02] Stranger In A Strange Land\n[03] Hideaway\n[04] It's Up To You\n[05] Night Of My Life\n[06] Above The Law\t&gt; Barbra Streisand &amp; Barry Gibb\n[07] Without Your Love\n[08] All The Children\n[09] Golden Dawn\n[10] (Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away\n[11] Letting Go\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:47m:41s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 113mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.5.0.20 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 19 September 2005\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Sony BMG\n\nArtist Website\t\t- \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barbrastreisand.com/us/home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barbrastreisand.com/us/home&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sonymusic.com/artists/BarbraStreisand/career_film.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sonymusic.com/artists/BarbraStreisand/career_film.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vh1.com/artists/az/barbra_streisand/artist.jhtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vh1.com/artists/az/barbra_streisand/artist.jhtml&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.oldielyrics.com/b/barbra_streisand.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.oldielyrics.com/b/barbra_streisand.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7530bb8e33d7512f8ad6e7ec1a686f34cfda0413","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Guilty+Too+-+Barbra+Streisand+-+113mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7530bb8e33d7512f8ad6e7ec1a686f34cfda0413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,48,187,142,51,215,81,47,138,214,231,236,26,104,111,52,207,218,4,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
