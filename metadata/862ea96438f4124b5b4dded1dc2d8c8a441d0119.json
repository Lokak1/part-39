Apple did not disclose any new features coming in 10.9.3, but we have discovered that the update includes notable enhancements for users with Macs connected to 4K-resolution monitors. With 10.9.3, Mac users can now natively set their 4K monitors to run the Mac operating system at a pixel-doubled Ã¢â‚¬Å“RetinaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ resolution.\n\nThe new settings, which appear nearly identical to the settings on a standard Retina MacBook Pro display, can be seen here on a 10.9.3 Mac connected to a 4K monitor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862ea96438f4124b5b4dded1dc2d8c8a441d0119","amp;dn":"OS+X+10.9.3+Beta+Build+13D12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862ea96438f4124b5b4dded1dc2d8c8a441d0119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,46,169,100,56,244,18,75,91,77,222,209,220,45,140,138,68,29,1,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
