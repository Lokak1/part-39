Living under Sharia law for the first thirty years of her life,a virtual slave to Islamic law, Darwish never questioned or challenged her rights--or dared to even think about the validity of Sharia laws. She didn't try to examine what Sharia was, how it came about or why she followed it. &quot;This is Allah's law,&quot; she was told, and she knew what awaited those who questioned Allah's law.\n\nBut she doesn't believe the lies anymore, and now she wants to share her experiences with the Western world. Cruel and Usual Punishment is an insider's look at how Muslims sacrifice their basic human rights to obey the archaic and brutal laws handed down to their prophet centuries ago.\n\nHeed this warning: Sharia Law is attempting to infiltrate Western culture and destroy democracy.\n\nAuthor: Nonie Darwish\nPublisher: Thomas Nelson\nPublication Date: January 6, 2009\n\nFormats:\n.ePub (compatable with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n.Mobi (compatable with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: http://calibre-ebook.com/download\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8052ff4789138a64f41c6725845f745934bed6ed","amp;dn":"Nonie+Darwish+-+Cruel+and+Usual+Punishment%3A+The+Terrifying+Globa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8052ff4789138a64f41c6725845f745934bed6ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,82,255,71,137,19,138,100,244,28,103,37,132,95,116,89,52,190,214,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
