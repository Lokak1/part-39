Currently I&amp;#039;m trying to get all the live-action Disney movies/tv specials pre-1995, so if you have any rare DVD/VHS rips I&amp;#039;d greatly appreciate if you&amp;#039;d upload them.\n\nPLOT : Young and awkward, The Coast-Guard&amp;#039;s ensign Thomas Garland suffers from the comparison with his late father, a war hero. Which does not prevent him from falling for pretty Kate Fairchild, a young woman who runs a sailing school. Of course the way he expresses his deep sympathy for the lady leaves to be desired. And the situation does not improve when a trio of bumbling jewel thieves interferes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:295bf7d9dc515df0a3aa30982c62446a4280b7ef","amp;dn":"Disney+Movie+-+The+Boatniks+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"295bf7d9dc515df0a3aa30982c62446a4280b7ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,91,247,217,220,81,93,240,163,170,48,152,44,98,68,106,66,128,183,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
