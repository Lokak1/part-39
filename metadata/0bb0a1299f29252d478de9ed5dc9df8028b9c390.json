The album established the band as international superstars, and Marley in particular became world-famous, especially in the Caribbean and Africa, and among immigrants in Europe and African-Americans in the United States. The socially aware lyrics and militant tone surprised many listeners, but others were attracted to songwriters Bob Marley and Peter Tosh's confrontational subjects and optimistic view of a future free from oppression.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.toptracker.ru/details.php?id=26&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.toptracker.ru/details.php?id=26&lt;/a&gt; Vote to say thanks! ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb0a1299f29252d478de9ed5dc9df8028b9c390","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+%26+The+Wailers++-+Catch+A+Fire+%28Deluxe+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb0a1299f29252d478de9ed5dc9df8028b9c390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,176,161,41,159,41,37,45,71,141,233,237,93,201,223,128,40,185,195,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
