Spanning over a period nearly 20 years, these rare recordings are some of the finest performances this artist has ever done.\n\nToby Walker is an award-winning acoustic fingerpicking blues guitarist. Without a doubt one of the very finest acoustic blues musicians alive today, this outstanding musician won the Best Performer in all categories at the prestigious International Blues Challenge in Memphis, TN. From the opening bars of his high-energy Piedmont style, it is easy to see why: Toby is a true master of this American music idiom.\n\nnightissuchproximity says: so you are into blues are you?
