Drifting from job to job: bottling plant, car wash, bowling alley, newspaper delivery, and in between enjoying the night life of the big city. Their previous life is looking better all the time. This movie is a time capsule of Toronto's Yonge Street - record stores (defunct A&amp;A's), bars, and old neighbourhood side street.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065788/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cae6cadbe9f3e4ec8d4aa4864fb86a512d11997","amp;dn":"Goin%5C%27+Down+the+Road+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cae6cadbe9f3e4ec8d4aa4864fb86a512d11997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,174,108,173,190,159,62,78,200,212,170,72,100,251,134,165,18,209,25,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
