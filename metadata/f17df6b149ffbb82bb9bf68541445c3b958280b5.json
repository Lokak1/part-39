What is x264? \n\n\nx264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!\n\n02. What is a .mkv file? \n\n\nMKV means &quot;matroska video&quot; and it is a &quot;extensible open standard Audio/Video container&quot; (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several videostreams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17df6b149ffbb82bb9bf68541445c3b958280b5","amp;dn":"Dexter+Season+2+Complete+DVDRip+x264+by+RiddlerA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f17df6b149ffbb82bb9bf68541445c3b958280b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,125,246,177,73,255,187,130,187,155,246,133,65,68,92,59,149,130,128,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
