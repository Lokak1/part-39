It premiered in Canada on the Comedy Network in 2002, and in Australia on The Comedy Channel in 2004.\n\nIn Puppets Who Kill, Rocko the Dog, Cuddles the Comfort Doll, Buttons the Bear, and Bill the Dummy are four live, anthropomorphic puppets with a history of delinquency and recidivism. Canadian courts sent each of them to a halfway house for puppets, operated by a man named Dan Barlow (played by Dan Redican).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73dafc349e54b2202b0e8262192f9ccf4c51c50f","amp;dn":"Puppets+Who+Kill+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73dafc349e54b2202b0e8262192f9ccf4c51c50f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,218,252,52,158,84,178,32,43,14,130,98,25,47,156,207,76,81,197,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
