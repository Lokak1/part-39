She celebrates the courageous army officers, academics, and everyday people who have supported the National League for Democracy, often at great risk to their own lives. She reveals how state oppression has adversely affected everything from the national diet to traditions of hospitality. She also evokes the beauty of the country's seasons and scenery, customs and fetivities, which remain-after everything-so close to her heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dfbf8ce2da4bb32c0b5f7d04d133946daee943e","amp;dn":"Aung+San+Suu+Kyi+-+Letters+From+Burma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dfbf8ce2da4bb32c0b5f7d04d133946daee943e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,251,248,206,45,164,187,50,192,181,247,208,77,19,57,70,218,238,148,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
