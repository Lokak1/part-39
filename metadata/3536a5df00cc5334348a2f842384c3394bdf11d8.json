DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and die. Today, hyperboles dominate the media, which makes parsing science from fiction an arduous task when deciding what to eat, what chemicals to avoid, and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best for the environment. \n\n In Is That a Fact?, bestselling author Dr. Joe Schwarcz carefully navigates through the storm of misinformation to help us separate fact from folly and shrewdness from foolishness.\n\n Are GMOs really harmful? Or could they help developing countries? Which Ã¢â‚¬Å“miracle weight-loss foodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gained popularity through exuberant data dredging? Is BPA dangerous or just a victim of unforgiving media hype? Is organic better? Dr. Joe questions the reliability and motives of Ã¢â‚¬Å“expertsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in this lighthearted but critical look at whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fact and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plain nonsense.\n\nepub\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3536a5df00cc5334348a2f842384c3394bdf11d8","amp;dn":"Is+That+a+Fact%3F%3A+Frauds%2C+Quacks%2C+and+the+Real+Science+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3536a5df00cc5334348a2f842384c3394bdf11d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,54,165,223,0,204,83,52,52,138,47,132,35,132,195,57,75,223,17,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
