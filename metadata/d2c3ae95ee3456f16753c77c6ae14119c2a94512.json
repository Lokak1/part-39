The contributions go beyond the conventional stereotypes of organized resistance to examine the tensions and ambiguities within the communities, both national and local, that opposed fascism. The authors show that under the pressures of civil conflict, occupation, and even everyday life, motives were rarely as pure and political alignments seldom as straightforward as our reassuring collective memories of fascism and war have led us to believe. The combination of original research and engagement with relevant debates makes this collection invaluable both for researchers in the social and political history of World War II and for students of modern European history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c3ae95ee3456f16753c77c6ae14119c2a94512","amp;dn":"Opposing+Fascism%3A+Community%2C+Authority+and+Resistance+in+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c3ae95ee3456f16753c77c6ae14119c2a94512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,195,174,149,238,52,86,241,103,83,199,124,106,225,65,25,194,169,69,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
