At the same time, it shipped foreign Prisoners of War captured overseas to the US for imprisonment.\nHeartland reflects on the intersection between these two historic events through the story of a German-born widow and her family who take in two German Prisoners of War to work their family farm. But the German-American family and the POWs bond too well for the townspeople to accept, and the widow is arrested, interned and eventually suffers a breakdown, which tears her family apart.\nBased on true stories, Heartland illustrates what can happen when fear and prejudice pit neighbor against neighbor in times of war. A dramatic tale that grants insights into American history, Heartland is a winner of the Dayton Playhouse FutureFest and a runner-up for the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival David Mark Cohen National Playwriting Award.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The story is shocking; for me it was revelatory,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ wrote theatre critic Pat Launer. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deporting our own citizens? Who knew? But the play, while conveying historical information, is not in the slightest didactic. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a family story, a tale of survival and acquiescence, of racism, of neighbor against neighbor. Not a pretty picture Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nWhile it may be read for pleasure, Heartland also is a useful tool for exposing students to important lessons in history, politics, economics, sociology, psychology, womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s studies and other academic disciplines.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Authors\nLojo Simon is a playwright, dramaturg and journalist.
