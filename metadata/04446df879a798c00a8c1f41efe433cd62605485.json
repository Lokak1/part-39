In addition to a wealth of tips, tricks and secrets, you\\\\\\'ll find advice and code examples for all tiers of your application, including the client, caching, IIS 7, ASP.NET, threads, session state, SQL Server, Analysis Services, infrastructure and operations. By applying the ultra-fast approach to your projects, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll squeeze every last ounce of performance out of your code and infrastructureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½giving your site unrivaled speed.\n\nThe approach is mostly prescriptive; rather than drowning you in options, the book presents and explains specific high-impact recommendations and demonstrates them with detailed examples. Using this knowledge, you will soon be building high-performance web sites that scale easily as your site grows.\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\n\nA way of thinking about performance issues that will help you obtain real results.\nHow to apply key principles that will help you build ultra-fast and ultra-scalable web sites.\nHow to use the ultra-fast approach to be fast in multiple dimensions. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have not only fast pages but also fast changes, fast fixes, fast deployments and more.\nTechniques that are being used by some of the world\\\\\\'s largest web sites.\nHow to structure your HTML and CSS to create pages that load ultra-fast.\nTips for using Silverlight, Ajax and IIS 7 to improve the performance of your site.\nHow to use comprehensive caching at all tiers to deliver content faster.\nWhy you should avoid traditional session state and how to make the best use of cookies.\nTips and tricks for optimizing your ASP.NET and SQL Server code for performance and scalability.\nHow to use Analysis Services to offload your relational database.\nWhy many sites that serve individual pages quickly are not scalable.\nHow to avoid common pitfalls that can have an adverse impact on your siteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance, both now and as it grows.\nHow to apply an end-to-end systems-based approach to web site performance and scalability, which includes everything from the browser and the network to caching, back-end operations, hardware infrastructure, and your software development process.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book will be useful for intermediate to advanced developers and architects who want to improve the performance of their ASP.NET-based web sites. Some knowledge of ASP.NET, SQL Server, and IIS is assumed. Example code is provided in C#. Experienced web developers who have recently moved from Java or PHP to .NET will find lots of valuable and interesting information.\n\nThis book will also be useful for non-developers who have a technical interest in what makes a web site fast. In particular, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re involved with web site operations, testing, or management, you will discover many of the principals and issues that your development teams should be addressing, along with demonstrations that help drive the points home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04446df879a798c00a8c1f41efe433cd62605485","amp;dn":"Ultra+Fast+ASP.NET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04446df879a798c00a8c1f41efe433cd62605485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,68,109,248,121,167,152,192,10,140,31,65,239,228,51,205,98,96,84,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
