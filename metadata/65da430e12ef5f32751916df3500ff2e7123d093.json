TV's Henry Gilbey sets out to demonstrate the art of successful shore fishing for bass with bait and high-tech lures, from beaches, estuaries and stunning rock locations.\n\n\nBass fishing the easy way, with incredible fish action, masses of tips and techniques, and of course, Henry's own brand of humour and fishing insanity.\n\nSequences of hectic bass fishing like you've never seen before, and all the thrills and spills of chasing such a magnificent, cult fish.\n\nFilmed on location in south east Ireland, this is the first truly professional bass fishing DVD available. Fast, frantic, mad, inspirational and downright fantastic, you will laugh, you will learn and you will ultimately catch more fish yourself.\n\nWelcome to the world of bass fishing like you've never seen it before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65da430e12ef5f32751916df3500ff2e7123d093","amp;dn":"Bass+Fishing+with+Henry+Gilbey+%28UK%29-%28Bait+and+Lure+Fishing%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65da430e12ef5f32751916df3500ff2e7123d093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,218,67,14,18,239,95,50,117,25,22,223,53,0,255,46,113,35,208,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
