That's only 47 shy of equaling our best numbers back in 2013.  And I've easily got another 47 titles laying around, ready, and waiting to be shared with you beyond today's torrent.  Not to mention over the past couple of months, through nothing more than a lack of interest, I have been turning away from plenty of music I could have been downloading.  So I may go back and revisit some of those downloads next month, time permitting.\n\nSINGER-SONGWRITER: Andrew McDade.  BLUEGRASS: Bluegrass Church Band, Keen Mountain Brothers.
