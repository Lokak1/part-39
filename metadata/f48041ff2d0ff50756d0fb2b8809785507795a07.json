The group was part of the English new wave movement that included bands like Duran Duran and had a string of early hit singles including &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Talk Talk&quot;, &quot;It's My Life&quot;, &quot;Such a Shame&quot;, and &quot;Dum Dum Girl&quot;. Always uncomfortable with the requirements and pressure of the pop industry, Talk Talk moved away from synthpop toward more experimental music in the mid-1980s. A few more singles, including &quot;Life's What You Make It&quot; and &quot;Living in Another World&quot;, achieved success in Europe and in the UK, but their commercial appeal receded quickly as their critical reputation increased.\n\nCompare Spirit of Eden with any other previous release in the Talk Talk catalog, and it's almost impossible to believe it's the work of the same band -- exchanging electronics for live, organic sounds and rejecting structure in favor of mood and atmosphere, the album is an unprecedented breakthrough, a musical and emotional catharsis of immense power. Mark Hollis' songs exist far outside of the pop idiom, drawing instead on ambient textures, jazz-like arrangements, and avant-garde accents; for all of their intricacy and delicate beauty, compositions like &quot;Inheritance&quot; and &quot;I Believe in You&quot; also possess an elemental strength -- Hollis' oblique lyrics speak to themes of loss and redemption with understated grace, and his hauntingly poignant vocals evoke wrenching spiritual turmoil tempered with unflagging hope. A singular musical experience. \n\nDFF files extracted with Scarletbook\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfrom the 2003 SACD.\n\nSACD-ISO-1Bit-2.8Mhz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48041ff2d0ff50756d0fb2b8809785507795a07","amp;dn":"Talk+Talk+-+Spirit+Of+Eden+%281988%29+2003+SACD-DFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48041ff2d0ff50756d0fb2b8809785507795a07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,128,65,255,45,15,245,7,86,208,251,43,136,9,120,85,7,121,90,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
