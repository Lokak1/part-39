Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, it was written by Leslie Bohem, and directed by Breck Eisner, FÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡lix EnrÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡quez AlcalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â , John Fawcett, Tobe Hooper, Jeremy Paul Kagan, Michael Katleman, Sergio Mimica-Gezzan, Bryan Spicer, Jeff Woolnough and Thomas J. Wright. The executive producers were Leslie Bohem and Steven Spielberg.\nWhen the show was launched, the Sci-Fi Channel used the simultaneous establishment of the organization Coalition for Freedom of Information in its promotion campaign. Both the Sci-Fi Channel and the Coalition for Freedom of Information are clients of Washington, D.C. public relations firm PodestaMattoon and this apparent commingling of clients did garner some criticism. The Coalition for Freedom of Information is a group which seeks the release of classified governmental UFO files as well as scientific, congressional and media credibility for the study of this subject.\nActors appearing in the program include Julie Benz, Emily Bergl, Terry Chen, Steve Burton, Eric Close, Heather Donahue, Dakota Fanning (who narrates, as well as starring as Allie Keys), Matt Frewer, Joel Gretsch, Ryan Hurst, Adam Kaufman, Ryan Merriman, Michael Moriarty and Anton Yelchin.\nA novelization was written by Thomas H. Cook.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO:\nTorrent Info Hash: 854a923e92db647d2312542c2c1cffb4367583d\neDonkey2000 Hash: 0e02ee4240a15be4e7b78056cbdb49e6 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289830/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289830/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\nPlease make sure you got latest codecs installed.
