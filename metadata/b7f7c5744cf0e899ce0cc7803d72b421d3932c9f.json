Eventually settling DJ Tiesto's reputation as the\nNumber 1 DJ Of The World that be became later on, the pivotal Magik\nseries covered seven volumes. ÃƒÂ´Magik Six: Live In AmsterdamÃƒÂ¶ now sees\nit's highly anticipated rerelease for the first time in the digital\ndomain. As with the rest of the Magik series, the album was a live\nturntable mix. It was recorded on June 23rd 2000 during a Wildlife event\nat Melkweg, Amsterdam.&quot;\n\nAs some of you maybe know, the official tracklist on the cover of the\noriginal CD had a couple of mislabels:\n1. Fratt Boy was actually North Pole\n5. Forever Young was actually Silent Cry\n16. Cloudwalking was actually the Astral Mix (not the original as\nindicated when no mix name is specified)\n\nAfter 12 years this is what they did with the digital re-release:\nRather than fixing the problem, Black Holy blindly included full\nversions of the tracks that were never part of the mix in the first\nplace. This includes the 3 tracks incorrectly printed on the original\ntracklist.\nIn addition to that, they managed to include a vinyl rip of &quot;Fred Numf\nvs. Etienne Overdijk&quot; - Waste Land wrongly tagged as &quot;Kamaya Painters&quot; -\nWasteland (which should have been the one included).\nFrom what we could tell, tracks 1, 2 and 8 are also vinyl rips.\n\nRarest unmixed tune of this release is probably Purple Cloud, which\nappears to be in digital quality!\n\nAlbum Art:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/7048/00vamagiksixliveinamste.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/7048/00vamagiksixliveinamste.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f7c5744cf0e899ce0cc7803d72b421d3932c9f","amp;dn":"VA-Magik+Six+Mixed+By+DJ+Tiesto-READ+NFO-WEB-2012-TSP-JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f7c5744cf0e899ce0cc7803d72b421d3932c9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,247,197,116,76,240,232,153,206,12,199,128,61,114,180,33,211,147,44,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
