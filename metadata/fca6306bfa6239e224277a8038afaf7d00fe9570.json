Modest (Elsevier-AP, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-12-386944-9\r\n\r\nThe third edition of Radiative Heat Transfer describes the basic physics of radiation heat transfer. The book provides models, methodologies, and calculations essential in solving research problems in a variety of industries, including solar and nuclear energy, nanotechnology, biomedical, and environmental.\r\n\r\nEvery chapter of Radiative Heat Transfer offers uncluttered nomenclature, numerous worked examples, and a large number of problems-many based on real world situations-making it ideal for classroom use as well as for self-study. The book's 24 chapters cover the four major areas in the field: surface properties; surface transport; properties of participating media; and transfer through participating media. Within each chapter, all analytical methods are developed in substantial detail, and a number of examples show how the developed relations may be applied to practical problems.\r\n\r\nExtensive solution manual for adopting instructors\r\nMost complete text in the field of radiative heat transfer\r\nMany worked examples and end-of-chapter problems\r\nLarge number of computer codes (in Fortran and C++), ranging from basic problem solving aids to sophisticated research tools\r\nCovers experimental methods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fca6306bfa6239e224277a8038afaf7d00fe9570","amp;dn":"Radiative+Heat+Transfer+3rd+ed+-+Michael+F.+Modest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fca6306bfa6239e224277a8038afaf7d00fe9570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,166,48,107,250,98,57,226,36,39,122,128,56,175,175,125,0,254,149,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
