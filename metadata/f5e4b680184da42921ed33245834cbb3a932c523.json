For its US release, Virgin renamed Bridge of Spies to simply T'Pau.\nThe album was produced by Roy Thomas Baker. It spawned five hit singles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; (also a Top 5 in the US), the best-selling number one hit &quot;China in Your Hand&quot; (re-recorded especially for single release), &quot;Valentine,&quot; a live version of &quot;Sex Talk&quot; (previously released in its original form as &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot;) and &quot;I Will Be with You&quot;. A further release, the title track &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, was also released in the US, Australia and Germany. The artwork for the release included the name &quot;T'Pau&quot; rearranged to form a face (similar to the Moai stone heads found on Easter Island). This practice was replicated with the titles of the bands follow-up albums Rage &amp; The Promise. The album spent one week at number one on the UK album chart and was certified Gold on 14 October 1987 and Platinum on 18 November 1987. It was eventually certified 4x Platinum in September 1988.\n\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Heart And Soul\n[02] I Will Be With You\n[03] China In Your Hand\n[04] Friends Like These\n[05] Sex Talk\n[06] Bridge Of Spies\n[07] Monkey House\n[08] Valentine\n[09] Thank You For Goodbye\n[10] You Give Up\n[11] China In Your Hand (Reprise)\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:44m:30s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 107mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
