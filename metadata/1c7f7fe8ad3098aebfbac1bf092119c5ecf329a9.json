An entirely irrelevant piece of trivia of course.\n\nThese shows, given for free in 2008 have over the years been acquiring owners &quot;while nobody's looking&quot; so to speak. Sony, of course, taking the lead.\n\nI should be more specific when I say &quot;free&quot;:\n\nThe performances were given for &quot;free&quot; where free is defined as follows:\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Immediate spectators (*unselected* audience members) were not required\n     to pay an admission charge.\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The performers were not reimbursed &quot;for the act of performing&quot; [*See below]\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Set materials (equipment), advertisement, related content distribution\n     charges etc. were paid through\n      a) Local government via the collection of taxes.\n      b) Voluntary donations (ie. payment without expectation of reimbursement)\n         by local businesses.\n      c) The use of federal government funds and publicly owned communications\n         networks (CRTC &amp; CBC).\n      d) Internet services also paid for by federal government agencies\n         (again CRTC &amp; CBC).\n\n* The performers were probably reimbursed for travel expenses and accommodation charges during their stay in Montreal. This does not constitute payment for performing. The reason being that, at the end of the day, none of them would have obtained any *monetary* profit as a result of the act of performing.\n\nIn any event, this AVI does not include all of the performances. I only selected the ones I liked which were as follows:\n\n1. Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye (Adam Cohen and Serina Ryder)\n2. Sisters Of Mercy (Serena Ryder)\n3. Suzanne (Leonard Cohen &amp; his band)\n4. Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen &amp; his band)\n5. Who By Fire (Lhasa de Sela)\n6. Closing Time (Leonard Cohen &amp; his band)\n\nThe original MPEG-PS file (possibly obtainable throughwas a 2000 Kbps video / 224 Kbps Audio file with dimensions 720x480 (3:2) containing a 4:3 aspect, internally letterboxed video where the content itself is in a 16:9 ratio (the extra black space being used for side-advertisements and heads-up overlays).\n\nI have thus cropped out the extra black space and enhanced the content section (mostly through initial &quot;pixel packing&quot; using &quot;Any Video Converter&quot; and then using &quot;HSV adjust&quot; through Virtual Dub (~10% increase in saturation) in order to produce this HDTV version, now at 1280x720 and about 5000 Kbps video. The resulting AVI specs are detailed below (the original file's details to follow below):\n\nEnhanced Video Details (enhancement by me, &quot;Any Video Converter&quot; and &quot;Virtual Dub&quot;):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Leonard Cohen -
