These are the best scans I could find.\n\nIn 1975, DC produced a comic book series titled Hercules Unbound, featuring the adventures of Hercules in a post-apocalyptic future. This Hercules looked different from the other DC interpretations - he had long black hair and no beard. The series lasted 12 issues. It made use of characters and concepts, such as The Atomic Knights and the intelligent animals from Jack Kirby's Kamandi series as an attempt to tie in some of the future series. It was later hinted that this version of Hercules was actually part of a dream suffered by Gardner Grayle, but was later shown to have existed somewhere in the Multiverse and was eliminated during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Bill Everett did some of the art on the early issues of this series, as did Walt Simonson, and Wally Wood inked some of them towards the end of his career.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddd9468804d2bb967eb990a5c94c4f53d9ffbdc4","amp;dn":"Hercules+Unbound+%28DC+Comics%29+Re-Upload","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddd9468804d2bb967eb990a5c94c4f53d9ffbdc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,217,70,136,4,210,187,150,126,185,144,165,201,76,79,83,217,255,189,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
