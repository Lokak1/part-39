In April 2004, Oddleif Stensland quit Scariot to fully focus on COMMUNIC for the future - so now all priority for both Oddleif and Tor Atle went into COMMUNIC.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1419b59e01bb9094f45aca35a4c27af3d9882469","amp;dn":"Communic+-+Discography+%282005-2008%5D+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1419b59e01bb9094f45aca35a4c27af3d9882469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,25,181,158,1,187,144,148,244,90,202,53,164,194,122,243,217,136,36,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
