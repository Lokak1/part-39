The first of these is the nine-song CD, The Burn Comes Down, which sequences new arrangements of traditional songs themed around winter. The recordings were made during short sessions after The View From A Hill (the forthcoming second release in the series, and a full-length album) was completed. Featuring the seven-strong Owl Service line-up and guest contributors (including Current 93's Joolie Wood) this half-hour EP tackles very faithful acappella renditions ('January Snows' and 'The Bitter Withy') as well as more modernised, electrified pieces ('Cold &amp; Raw'), culminating in the beautifully ornate, slightly psychedelic folk-rock configuration of 'Winter (A Dirge)' based on Robert Burns' words.\n\n1   January Snows (Fragment)    \n    Arranged By, Vocals - Alison O'Donnell  \n2   Drive The Cold Winter Away    \n3   When A Man's In Love    \n    Piano - Roshi Nasehi \n  Strings - Joolie Wood  \n4   Fire &amp; Wine (Fragment)    \n5   The Bitter Withy    \n6   Cold &amp; Raw    \n7   January Snows    \n8   The Snow It Melts The Soonest (Fragment)    \n    Arranged By, Vocals - Alison O'Donnell  \n9   Winter (A Dirge)  \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca402b0c0a046d2f9f9a0d1783eb8e1103522dfb","amp;dn":"the+Owl+Service...The+Burn+Comes+Down+%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca402b0c0a046d2f9f9a0d1783eb8e1103522dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,64,43,12,10,4,109,47,159,154,13,23,131,235,142,17,3,82,45,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
