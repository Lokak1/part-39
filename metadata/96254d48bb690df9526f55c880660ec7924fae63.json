The foursome, bassist Tamaki (the lone female in the group), drummer Yasunori Takada, and guitarists Takaakira &quot;Taka&quot; Goto and Yoda, released their first full-length record, Under the Pipal Tree, in 2001 on John Zorn's Tzadik label. In 2003, after switching to Arena Rock Recording Company, Mono issued One Step More and You Die, a remix version of which came out the following year as New York Soundtracks. That same year their fourth album, Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined, recorded in Chicago with producer Steve Albini, was released on Temporary Residence. Albini also performed the same duties on Mono's April 2006 record, You Are There, and in September the band issued Palmless Prayer/Mass Murder Refrain, a mix between classical and rock that also collaborated with World's End Girlfriend, among others. The fascination with classical arrangements, strings, and atmospheres became an integral part of the band's sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96254d48bb690df9526f55c880660ec7924fae63","amp;dn":"Mono+-+5+Albums+%282001-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96254d48bb690df9526f55c880660ec7924fae63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,37,77,72,187,105,13,249,82,111,85,200,128,102,14,199,146,79,174,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
