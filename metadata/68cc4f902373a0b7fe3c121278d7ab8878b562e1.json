Marshall - Drums, percussion \nCharles Hayward - Bass \n\nThe Charlie Daniels Band's most popular album, 1979's MILLION MILE REFLECTIONS, is best known for its deathless hit single &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia.&quot; That's far from its only attribute, though, as this is probably the group's most consistently listenable album. &quot;Reflections&quot; is a minor classic, a tribute to dead country and rock stars--most notably Ronnie Van Zandt of Lynyrd Skynyrd--that unlike most songs of this ilk manages to keep from being saccharine or soppy.\n\nThe rip-snorting &quot;Passing Lane&quot; is one of Daniels' best all-out rockers, and the contributions from band members Tommy Crain (&quot;Blind Man&quot;) and Taz (&quot;Jitterbug&quot;) are well above their usual Ringo-song status. Novices should probably start with one of the many Charlie Daniels Band compilations to get the band's full effect, but this is easily the band's best studio album.\n\n1.&quot;Passing Lane&quot; - 3:17 \n2.&quot;Blue Star&quot; - 3:40 \n3.&quot;Jitterbug&quot; (Daniels, Crain, DiGregorio, Edwards, Hayward, Don Murray) - 3:11 \n4.&quot;Behind Your Eyes&quot; (John Boylan) - 3:56 \n5.&quot;Reflections&quot; - 5:26 \n6.&quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot; - 3:37 \n7.&quot;Mississippi&quot; (Daniels) - 3:10 \n8.&quot;Blind Man&quot; (Crain) - 3:46 \n9.&quot;Rainbow Ride&quot; - 7:24 \n\nIf you like the album, buy it and support the artist!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68cc4f902373a0b7fe3c121278d7ab8878b562e1","amp;dn":"The+Charlie+Daniels+Band+-+Million+Mile+Reflections+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68cc4f902373a0b7fe3c121278d7ab8878b562e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,204,79,144,35,115,160,183,254,60,18,18,120,215,171,136,120,181,98,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
