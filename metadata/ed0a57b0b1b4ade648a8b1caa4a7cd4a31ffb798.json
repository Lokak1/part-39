Now back home in New Bordeaux, Lincoln is set on escaping a criminal past. But when his surrogate family, the black mob, is betrayed and wiped out by the Italian Mafia, Lincoln builds a new family on the ashes of the old and blazes a path of military-grade revenge through those responsible. Intense gun fights, visceral hand-to-hand combat, white knuckle driving and street smarts will all be needed. But with the right crew, tough decisions and some dirty hands, itâ€™s possible to make it to the top of the city's underworld. \r\n\r\nNEW BORDEAUX, A REIMAGINED 1968 NEW ORLEANS:\r\nA vast, diverse and seedy open world ruled by the mob and corrupt officials and richly detailed with the sights, sounds and emotionally-charged social atmosphere of the era.\r\nAN UNINTENDED AND LETHAL ANTI-HERO:\r\nBe Lincoln Clay, an orphan and Vietnam veteran hell bent on revenge against the Italian Mafia for the brutal slaughter of the black mob, the closest thing to family heâ€™s ever had.\r\nREVENGE YOUR WAY:\r\nChoose your own personal play-style, from brute force and blazing guns to stalk-and-kill tactics as you use Lincolnâ€™s military training and gathered intel to tear down the Italian Mafia.\r\nA NEW FAMILY ON THE ASHES OF THE OLD:\r\nBuild a new criminal empire in your own unique way by deciding which of your lieutenants you reward, and which you betrayâ€¦\r\n\r\nMafia III because patch 1.01 is now available for download.
