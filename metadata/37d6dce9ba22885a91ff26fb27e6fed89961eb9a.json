Co-produced by The Open University, Berlin is a new three-part documentary written and presented by award-winning, German-born, journalist Matt Frei, who unveils the turbulent and dramatic story of this city from the Prussian years right through to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n\n\n1)  Dangerous Ideas \nThe 18th-century king Frederick the Great was a contradictory character whose legacy would define Berlin as a place of both aggressive militarism and enlightened idealism. He would be embraced as an icon by Hitler and, later, the Communist leaders in East Berlin. But Frederick's liberalism created a city in which new theories of sex and sexuality could flourish, inspiring groundbreaking art.\nDuring the Cold War, the street that bore the king's name, Friedrichstrasse, was also brutally divided - and irreconcilable. Only after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 was King Frederick returned to his desired resting place. The funeral was intended as a laying-to-rest of more than just a body.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3824/mattfreisberlinscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3824/mattfreisberlinscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1329/mattfreisberlinscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1329/mattfreisberlinscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3612/mattfreisberlinscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3612/mattfreisberlinscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9011/mattfreisberlinscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9011/mattfreisberlinscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/779/mattfreisberlinscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/779/mattfreisberlinscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6856/mattfreisberlinscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6856/mattfreisberlinscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD\n * Video Bitrate: 1584 KB/s\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1:76\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 400\n * Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s 48000Hz\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25FPS\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746mb/s\n * Ripped by artistharry\n * Subtitles: English\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d6dce9ba22885a91ff26fb27e6fed89961eb9a","amp;dn":"BBC+Matt+Freis+Berlin+1of3+Dangerous+Ideas+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d6dce9ba22885a91ff26fb27e6fed89961eb9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,214,220,233,186,34,136,90,145,255,38,251,39,230,254,216,153,97,235,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
