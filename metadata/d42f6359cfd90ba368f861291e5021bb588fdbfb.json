Info:\nSONY D6 + AIWA CM 30 Mic -&gt; mastertape -&gt; transfer via Nakamichi tapedeck DR3 -&gt; wav-file -&gt; wetransfer -&gt; Magix Music Cleaning Lab (edit/remaster) -&gt; FLAC -&gt; DIME \nVery good sounding recording after some EQ was done (bass and treble lifted). One gap in track 17 removed (I think you won't hear it).\n\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen here is a so far uncirculated show from our hero right from the depths of NÃƒÂ¼rnberg's RÃƒÂ¼herersaal (nice little tongue twister for all lowbrows of German language).\nFor Thunders hardcore fans the 1988 tour took maybe a little getting used to due to the sax attendance and the lady vocals in the background but at the end that's just some nice\naccessories to the man himself who stayed what he always was, the greatest impersonator of dirty ass rock'n'roll.\nTo him it was always a seal of approval that never one show was like the other. And on this tour even the songs seemed to be different from show to show. Here we get a wonderful version of\nof So Alone and a marathon on Gloria right at the end of the concert.\nI would love to see a tape of the show from Munich 3 days earlier where I have been but maybe even this will appear one day.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSetlist (tape length 89:04)\n\n01 - Intro\n02 - Glory Glory  \n03 - Blame It On Mom\n04 - In Cold Blood -&gt; I'm Not Your Stepping Stone/Hit the Road Jack\n05 - I Can Tell\n06 - Sad Vacation\n07 - Just Another Girl\n08 - Crazy\n09 - Pipeline\n10 - Louie Louie/Hang On Sloopy\n11 - ? \n12 - Too Much Junkie Business\n13 - Children Are People Too\n14 - Little Queenie\n15 - Uptown To Harlem \n16 - So Alone\n17 - Born To Lose\n18 - Gloria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnny Thunders and The Oddballs:\n\nJohnny Thunders - lead vocals, lead guitar\nStevie Klasson - guitar\nJill Wisoff - bass\nJamie Heath - saxophone\nAlison Gordy - vocals \nChris Musto - drums\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport the artists, go to their shows (sadly not possible anymore), buy their albums.\nDo not convert to lossy files, unless for personal use.
