Buckminster Fuller, produced and directed by four time Academy Award nominees Karen Goodman and Kirk Simon. Cinematography by Buddy Squires, edited by Sara Fishko and a Production of Simon &amp; Goodman Picture Company.\n\nFuller is considered by some to be one of the 20th century's most noteworthy, controversial and creative thinkers, since his death in 1983. The film looks at his unconventional life, his innovations, and his radical view of the contemporary world. Best known as the inventor of the Geodesic Dome, Fuller had many other inventions, such as an air-streamed three-wheeled car, and ideas of how to &quot;benefit mankind.&quot;\n\nThe film includes interviews with Philip Johnson, Merce Cunningham, John Cage and Arthur Penn. It is narrated by Morley Safer and Spalding Gray is the voice of Buckminster Fuller. The filmmakers were the first journalists to have open access to the vast collections of Fuller's personal papers. As Fuller was widely documented, the film includes extensive archival footage of Fuller from scores of sources. The film premiered in competition at the Sundance Film Festival in 1996 and was nominated for an Emmy for Best Cultural/Historical Documentary the same year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa62be82a0177e191632353a43e868e48cd6daf6","amp;dn":"Buckminster+Fuller+-+Thinking+Out+Loud+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa62be82a0177e191632353a43e868e48cd6daf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,98,190,130,160,23,126,25,22,50,53,58,67,232,104,228,140,214,218,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
