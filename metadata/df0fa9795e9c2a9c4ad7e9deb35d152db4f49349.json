The Square\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hardest Part Of Leaving is evidence that Pert Near Sandstone understand the traditions of the bluegrass genre Ã¢â‚¬â€ they channel old-time bluegrass traditions into a record both modern and timeless.\n\nUnlike the work of Minneapolis bluegrass contemporaries Trampled By Turtles, the tracks remain relatively short and centered around the vocalist, recorded with a distinct live feel but rarely focusing on a single playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musicianship.\n\nFortunately, the songwriting delivers, offering unique and soulful songs that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t often lean on bluegrass clichÃƒÂ©s, or any cliches for that matter.\n\nThough songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wish This Was New OrleansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Couple Off The TopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ walk a fine line between light-hearted and inane, tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“His IslandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ go deeper, the lyrics a social observation of anotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Look out for his island/ You can never swim therein/ He will only hold up there and be content with sin,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they sing, observing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“every guy is great when you meet him.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe band remains within the stylistic confounds of the bluegrass genre but still explores within this context, providing variety without losing unity.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Walk Right In BelmontÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has an old-time music feel, fiddle running throughout the background. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the kind of song that begs for backbeat handclaps, if not all-out square dancing.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Coming HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is reminiscent of early country pioneers like Bill Monroe, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“25th &amp; RiversideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds unmistakably modern. Piano creeps into Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re No Good To MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for a light ragtime feel, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“In BetweenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a dark, minor tune.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“StaggerleeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SquareÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ find the band playing into their strengths, combining timeless melodies with traditional, joyful backing.\n\nThough traditional bluegrass fans seeking heart-stopping chops need not look here, The Hardest Part Of Leaving proves Pert Near Sandstone competent and able to produce a record that, above all else, is good, clean fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df0fa9795e9c2a9c4ad7e9deb35d152db4f49349","amp;dn":"Pert+Near+Sandstone+-+The+Hardest+Part+Of+Leaving+%5B2014%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df0fa9795e9c2a9c4ad7e9deb35d152db4f49349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,15,169,121,94,156,42,156,74,215,233,222,179,93,21,45,180,244,147,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
