The album has 97 tracks and is in a\ntwo-part zip. Part one has tracks 1-35 and part 2 has 36-97. Encoded at 192 cbr\nmp3. This is the game rip that can be found on KH insider only things have been\nfixed up a bit. (Copied from OP)\n==================================================================================\n\nI extracted both zip files and put them in one folder. The gamerip not only\ncontains original music, but unused music as well. It is well organized and a\nhefty thanks to fywfoe for this unofficial release it so I could upload it as a\ntorrent for all to download, listen, and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e31eda97132d28938efea163a082eb8a61ac7793","amp;dn":"David+Wise+-+Star+Fox+Adventures+%28Gamerip+2002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e31eda97132d28938efea163a082eb8a61ac7793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,30,218,151,19,45,40,147,142,254,161,99,160,130,235,138,97,172,119,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
