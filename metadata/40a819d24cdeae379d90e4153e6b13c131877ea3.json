Nearby the bomber crews relax or sleep, only 15 minutes or less from takeoff.\nSimultaneously, at scores of underground missile control centers, other Air Force officers live day to day in the presence of controls for launching more than a thousand intercontinental missiles.\nAt the same time, high above the United States, a large aircraft circles continuously, always relieved \\&quot;on station,\\&quot; to keep a SAC general airborne with a command staff, with communications available to control all SAC bombers and missiles should the primary SAC command center near Omaha, Nebraska, be destroyed.\nThese are the principal elements of the land-based strategic striking forces of the United States, the Strategic Air Command. With the U.S. Navy\\'s submarine-launched ballistic missiles, SAC provides the nation\\'s strategic deterrence against nuclear war. These three strategic striking forcesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which form the so-called TRIADÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are a primary factor in U.S. defense strategy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40a819d24cdeae379d90e4153e6b13c131877ea3","amp;dn":"Strategic+Air+Command+People%2C+Aircraft%2C+and+Missiles%28amitks93%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40a819d24cdeae379d90e4153e6b13c131877ea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,168,25,210,76,222,174,55,157,144,228,21,62,107,19,193,49,135,126,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
