It is a story wrapped in a curious mixture of time and\nlegend, betrayal, conspiracyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and murder. Native Americans referred to it as their power mountain, the command at White Sands Missile Range call it Soledad, and the Central Intelligence Agency code-named it Deep Space. The FBI classified certain activities there under Operation 62385-11.\n\nThe White House refers to this place as case number WH 22036. To the people who know its secrets, it is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Victorio Peak.\n\nAuthor's background:\nJohn Clarence co-authored his first book in 1979, a slim volume entitled Three Mile Island: A Time of Fear, the first published book chronicling the events that followed the March 28, 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear plant incident in Pennsylvania.

A TV show based on the true events of a kidnapping in Shade Gap, Pennsylvania aired on ABC in the mid-1980s.
