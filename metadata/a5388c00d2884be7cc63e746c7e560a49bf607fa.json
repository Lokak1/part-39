Handbook of Modeling High-Frequency Data in Finance addresses the many theoretical and practical questions raised by the nature and intrinsic properties of this data.\n\nA one-stop compilation of empirical and analytical research, this handbook explores data sampled with high-frequency finance in financial engineering, statistics, and the modern financial business arena. Every chapter uses real-world examples to present new, original, and relevant topics that relate to newly evolving discoveries in high-frequency finance, such as:\n\nDesigning new methodology to discover elasticity and plasticity of price evolution\n\nConstructing microstructure simulation models\n\nCalculation of option prices in the presence of jumps and transaction costs\n\nUsing boosting for financial analysis and trading\n\nThe handbook motivates practitioners to apply high-frequency finance to real-world situations by including exclusive topics such as risk measurement and management, UHF data, microstructure, dynamic multi-period optimization, mortgage data models, hybrid Monte Carlo, retirement, trading systems and forecasting, pricing, and boosting. The diverse topics and viewpoints presented in each chapter ensure that readers are supplied with a wide treatment of practical methods.\n\nHandbook of Modeling High-Frequency Data in Finance is an essential reference for academics and practitioners in finance, business, and econometrics who work with high-frequency data in their everyday work. It also serves as a supplement for risk management and high-frequency finance courses at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface xi\nContributors xiii\n\nPart One Analysis of Empirical Data 1\n\n1 Estimation of NIG and VG Models for High Frequency Financial Data 3\nJosÃƒÂ© E.
