Many of his most satisfying recordings have placed him in a solo setting, where his timing eccentricities don't disrupt the proceedings (though he's made some fine band-backed waxings as well).\n\nWilliamson was playing guitar at age ten and soon ran away from his Tennessee home to play at fish fries and dances. His travels took the guitarist through Mississippi and North Carolina during the 1920s, where he crossed paths with Yank Rachell, Sleepy John Estes, Blind Boy Fuller, and Big Joe Williams.\nSettling in Chicago during the 1930s, Williamson played local clubs and recorded for RCA Victor in 1937. Williamson made some of his finest sides in 1952-53 for Art Sheridan's Chance Records (including the classic &quot;Homesick&quot; that gave him his enduring stage name).\nJames also worked extensively as a sideman, backing harp great Sonny Boy Williamson in 1945 at a Chicago gin joint called the Purple Cat and during the 1950s with his cousin, slide master Elmore James (to whom Homesick is stylistically indebted). He also recorded with James during the 1950s. Homesick's own output included crashing 45s for Colt and USA in 1962, a fine 1964 album for Prestige, and four tracks on a Vanguard anthology in 1965.\n\nNo matter what his current chronological age, there's nothing over-the-hill about the blues of Homesick James Williamson.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Set A Day 2:47\n02- Go Away, Go Away Blues 2:13\n03- Alligator Man 3:33\n04- Been 'round A Long Time 2:34\n05- No More Lovin' 2:44\n06- All Alone  3:58\n07- Homesick Blues 2:18\n08- Telephone 2:27\n09- I Got To Move 2:48\n10- Workin' With Homesick 2:55\n11- Unlucky 3:35[/size]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15da849c80bd8789f1544949a3dfa996dc1b6cfa","amp;dn":"Homesick+James+The+Country+Blues+%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15da849c80bd8789f1544949a3dfa996dc1b6cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,218,132,156,128,189,135,137,241,84,73,73,163,223,169,150,220,27,108,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
