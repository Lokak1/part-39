The screenplay by John Gay is based on the novel Film of Memory by Maurice Druon. The fictional story is based loosely on the real life exploits of the infamous Italian eccentric, the Marchesa Casati, whom Druon knew during her declining years in London while he was stationed there during World War II. The film marked the first screen appearance for Isabella Rossellini and the last for Charles Boyer, and proved to be Minnelli's final project.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074878/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074878/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x528\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1408 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 160 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e38fd02f549013d9638f13b53985ba80ec5b9d8","amp;dn":"A+Matter+of+Time+%281976%29++%28Ingrid+Bergman%2C+Liza+Minnelli%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e38fd02f549013d9638f13b53985ba80ec5b9d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,56,253,2,245,73,1,61,150,56,241,59,83,152,91,168,14,197,185,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
