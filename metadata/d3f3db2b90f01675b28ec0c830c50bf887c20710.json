We are so familiar with the map of United    \n         States, but do we know why our states look the way they       \n         do? Every shape on the map tells a great story about our      \n         past. Why is California bent? To cling on to gold. Why does   \n         Oklahoma have a panhandle? Because of shifting borders        \n         for slavery. Why does Missouri have a boot? Because of        \n         a massive earthquake. This special examines how every         \n         state is a puzzle piece ultimately revealing the unique       \n          geography, political and social history of America.           \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
