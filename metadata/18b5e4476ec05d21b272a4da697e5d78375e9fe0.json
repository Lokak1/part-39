This award-winning and production-proven product handles the most challenging shots without the need for additional plug-ins or an army of programmers. Film production facilities can rely on Houdini Master to help them create stunning feature film effects and character animation.\nFeatures:\nHoudini Master is a full-featured 3D animation and\nvisual effects software renowned for its node-based procedural workflow. Houdini Master is indispensible for visual effects artists and technical directors (TDs) and includes a fully unified dynamics environment. Houdini Escape is a complete 3D modeling, animation, lighting, rendering and compositing package that works well on its own or with Houdini Master. Houdini Escape includes strong character animation features such as\npowerful auto-rigging and muscle tools.\nInteroperability: Use Houdini Master to set up sophisticated particle and physical effects, then view and render them in Houdini Escape. Encapsulate those effects into Houdini Digital Assets, and you can bring them into Houdini Escape as interactive artist tools.\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new in Houdini 10:\n\nDynamics:\n\nThe new Pyro FX shelf tools let you create production-quality smoke and fire effects quickly. The shelf tools are backed by new DOP nodes (Pyro solver), SOP nodes (DOP I/O surface node), and a very flexible, production material (Pyro material). More information.\nYou can now divide the work of a fluid simulation and distribute it to multiple networked computers.\nThe wire, fluid, and cloth solvers are now faster due to multi-threading and/or algorithmic improvements.\n\nMotion FX:\n\nMotion FX allows you to easily add CHOPs effects to parameters using the parameters menu. More information.\nYou can add effects to objects using the Lag Object and Jiggle Object tools on the Animation shelf tab.\n\nFur:\nYou can now create a clear part line in combed fur by using the Add Parting tool on the shelf.\nReplaced parameters on the Fur Object for specifying how thickness, frizz, and color vary along the length of each hair with ramps.\n\nNetwork usability:\nThe network editor now has a toolbar to allow easier access to network functionality. Use the network editors Gear menu to turn the toolbar off.\nSticky notes in the network. Press Ctrl + P to create a new note. More information.\nYou can now nest network boxes inside each other.\nImprovements to wiring.\nShaking a node disconnects it.\nDropping a node onto a wire connects it. Hold ? Shift to connect the next free input instead of the first one. This new behavior is disabled if you turn selectable wires off in the main preferences.\n\nDropped nodes now automatically snap to line up with their parents and siblings. More information.\n\nHolding ? Shift while dragging a node will move it with its children, and holding ? Shift + Ctrl will move the node with its parents. You can also turn on a checkbox called Move Tiles With Their Children on the Network editor page of the main preferences, which automatically move it together with its children.\n\nYou can now press B in the network editor to quickly set/unset the bypass flag on the node under the mouse pointer. Press ? Shift + B to set/unset the bypass flags on the selected nodes.\n\nYou can now use the HOUDINI_NODE_WIDTH environment variable to control the width of nodes in the network editor. The variable is a multiple of the flag width.\n\nThe current node (the node displayed in the parameter editor) is now marked in the network editor with a dark outline when its not selected.\n\nGeneral usability:\nMotion Effects let you very easily override a parameter with a CHOP network, allowing you to quickly apply an effect such as jitter or overshoot. More information.\nThere is now stereoscopic viewing in the viewport, a stereo camera rig, stereoscopic rendering in ROPs, and stereoscopic MPlay and IPR viewing. The stereo camera rig is also on the Lights and Cameras tab of the shelf. More information.\nBetter display and manipulation performance.\nMulti-line editor fields, such as on the Code tab in the type properties window, now feature a toolbar with common editing functions.\nExpression evaluation is now faster.\n\nShading and rendering:\nThe render view now supports fast previews that update as you change parameters. More information.\nNew production-quality Pyro shader. More information.\nNew occlusion materials. Useful for general occlusion passes, occlusion-for-compositing passes, or simple colored/textured type occlusion renders. More information.\nNew Simple Ramp material in the palette, which makes for a useful x-ray or toon type material. More information.\nVOP networks now automatically convert datatypes when possible. You can middle-click an auto-converted connection and choose to create an explicit conversion node.\nThe PBR rendering engine is now implemented in VEX. This allows you to export deep raster variables in PBR and to use a shader to control PBR rendering.\nYou can now export deep raster planes such as direct_diffuse (Direct lighting, diffuse component) and direct_glossy (Direct lighting, glossy component) from PBR.\nBetter filtering of shadow maps (also in 9.5).\n\nNew shelf tools:\n\nThe new Pyro FX shelf tab contains new pyro effects tools.\nThere are two new Cloth shelf tools.\nElastic Object is useful for simulating objects that try to regain their original shapes after a collision, such as a rubber ball.\nDentable Object is useful for simulating objects that do not try to regain their original shapes after a collision, such as a crushed can.\nThere is a new Animation shelf tab.\nLag Object uses Motion FX to add lag to an object.\nJiggle Object uses Motion FX to add jiggle to an object.\nThe Freeze transforms tool pushes an objects Scene-level transforms down into a Transform surface node at the geometry level.\nThe Knife tool lets you interactively split polygons along a drawn line.\nThe Edge loop tool lets you easily insert a loop of edges in quad polygon geometry.\n\nOther improvements:\nMac port is faster and more reliable.\nHOM is more completely implemented and better documented.\nMany improvements and new options in FBX translation.\nThe context menu for parameters is now defined by an editable XML file.\nNew Houdini Dark color scheme available in the color settings menu.\nScripts can now disable ramp parameters.\nBug fixes and optimizations.\n\n: Windows XP and Windows Vista x64, Linux, MacOS X","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b5e4476ec05d21b272a4da697e5d78375e9fe0","amp;dn":"SideFX+Houdini+Master%29V11.0.469++%2Fx64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18b5e4476ec05d21b272a4da697e5d78375e9fe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,181,228,71,110,192,93,33,178,114,164,218,105,126,93,120,55,94,159,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
