And that is sure to piss off a guy who owns the fastest car in the west... or the east. Doesn't matter.\nSquare: Honestly? Nobody really cares about your poor, little car. It's also so boring.\nShark: Well... [he presses a button -- a building in the background explodes] ...  They better start caring, [he presses it more] because I care about it a lot, ya dig?\nSquare: Oh, I dig. And I know that you dig what you dig. I hope he digs what you dig.

Instead, he kidnaps him and takes him to a pornset, where he tries to make a porn film with him and a doll. Frustrated by his non-cooperation, he blows him up with the set, and robs a bank with his pal, Skillet. Then he flies to the bar where he orders one hundred beers (oh, I mentioned he travels by jet, right?). Mouse gropes a woman, and she repels him by turning into a man. He does some opera singing when a police officer comes in and asks him, &quot;Is that your jet outside...?  The one with the bullet holes in it, and the bags of money in the backseat?&quot;\n\nDescription: 12 oz. Mouse is an animated television series on the American channel Cartoon Network as part of the Adult Swim late night programming block. The show centers on the antisocial actions of an alcoholic mouse known as &quot;Mouse Fitzgerald&quot;, &quot;Fitz,&quot; &quot;Butch,&quot; or simply &quot;Mouse&quot;. The show was created by Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and produced by Williams Street for Adult Swim.\n\nThe series is animated in the style of crude drawings with limited motion. The usage of firearms, alcohol consumption, and indifferent homicidal acts are common activities of the sociopathic lead character Mouse Fitzgerald.\n\nThe plot revolves around a bizarre conspiracy which is constantly building on itself and taking seemingly nonsensical twists and turns. At times the narrative becomes obfuscated or nonlinear, but it simultaneously reveals connections that hint at an objective story. The dialogue is cryptic. Clues and secret messages are hidden throughout each episode, including the credits. Creator Matt Maiellaro has indicated that the development of 12 oz. Mouse was influenced in part by the Theatre of the Absurd, and surrealistic films such as those by director David Lynch. Written in serial format, each episode picks up where the previous one left off.\n\nThe series concluded its initial run on Adult Swim on December 18, 2006 with its twentieth episode, leaving the plot unresolved. In February 2007, production began on additional episodes for internet distribution on Adult Swim Video. The first online episode premiered May 16, 2007.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_oz._mouse\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465774/\n\nCreator: Matt Maiellaro (co-creator of Aqua Teen Hunger Force).\nWriters: Matt Maiellaro, Matt Harrigan (writer of Assy McGee, Tom Goes to the Mayor, Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job, and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law).\nDirector: Matt Maiellaro.\nStarring: Adam Reed, Nick Weidenfeld, Bonnie Rosmarin, Kurt Soccolich, Dave Willis, Matt Harrigan, Nick Ingkatanuwat, Vishal Roney, Scott Luallen, Melissa Warrenburg, Matt Thompson.\n\nVLC Player Compatible (version # 0.9.9): {Tested and Confirmed}\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01 - Hired [Geophage].avi\nS1E02 - Signals [Moonsong].avi\nS1E03 - Rooster [Moonsong].avi\nS1E04 - Spider (Alternate Version) [Moonsong].avi\nS1E04 - Spider [IcyFlamez].avi\nS1E05 - Rememorized [Moonsong].avi\nS1E06 - Spharktasm [Moonsong].avi\nS1E07 - Adventure Mouse [Moonsong].avi\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS2E01 - Bowtime [Demon].avi\nS2E02 - Surgery Circus [Demon].avi\nS2E03 - Booger Haze [Demon].avi\nS2E04 - Star Wars VII [Demon].avi\nS2E05 - Enjoy The Arm [Demon].avi\nS2E06 - Auraphull [Demon].avi\nS2E07 - Meat Warrior [Demon].avi\nS2E08 - Meaty Dreamy [Demon].avi\nS2E09 - Corndog Chronicles [Demon].avi\nS2E10 - Eighteen [Demon].avi\nS2E11 - Pre-reckoning [Demon].avi\nS2E12 - Farewell [Demon].avi\nS2E13 - Prolegomenon [Demon].avi\n\nSeason 3...\n\nS3E01 - Enter the Sandmouse [BloodLogic].avi\n\nExtras...\n\nExtras - Full Credits [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Baked Officer Standup Comedy #1 [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Baked Officer Standup Comedy #2 [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Corn Dogs [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Dancing Eyeball [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Give It To Me [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Good Show [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Great American Literature.avi\nPromo - Gunfight Shootout [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - I Am Such A Dick.avi\nPromo - Metal Mantage [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - Mouse Guitar Solo [IcyFlamez].avi\nPromo - My Head!

It was 12 Oz. Mouse, Seasons 1-2, Complete, so I just combined that with the new season, plus some other extras that I was able to find. Now it's an even more complete collection. I deleted the old torrent to make room for this one. Enjoy!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Three.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6af6017fccfe1a79d9b6094e030d3a9c4d48c5f1","amp;dn":"12+Oz.+Mouse+-+Seasons+1-3+%2B+Extras+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6af6017fccfe1a79d9b6094e030d3a9c4d48c5f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,246,1,127,204,254,26,121,217,182,9,78,3,13,58,156,77,72,197,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
