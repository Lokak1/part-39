My OS is Windows XP sp3.\n\nDirections:\n1) Disable your antivirus program\n2) Unrar the files.\n3) Run the SETUP program\n4) Overwrite the Steam files in the game folder with those in CRACK.RAR.\n4) Exclude the game folder from your antivirus program, and enable it.\n5) Run the game.\n6) Defeat the alien towers.\n7) Enjoy!\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n* The steam_api.dll file gets a false positive flag from your antivirus program, so be sure it is \n\ndisabled when you overwrite the files from my crack folder to the game folder.\n* Also, exclude in your antivirus program the folder where the game gets installed.\n* The settings and save files are stored in C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication \n\nDataSteamAnomaly2. (Be sure your Windows Explorer settings are set so these folders are not \n\nhidden)\n* In case the crack files get deleted by your antivirus program, I stored a copy in the crack.zip \n\nfile (password = gmc). Be sure to disable your antivirus program before retrieving these files.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9619b53d60374d93a2b5280efff75e1db81cf91b","amp;dn":"Anomaly+2+PC+for+Windows+XP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9619b53d60374d93a2b5280efff75e1db81cf91b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,25,181,61,96,55,77,147,162,181,40,14,255,247,94,29,184,28,249,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
