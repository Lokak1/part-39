He gained prominence as lead guitarist of the British progressive rock group Genesis, which he joined in 1970 and left in 1977 to pursue a solo career. This newest album has been described by Hackett himself as his best work. His impressive and varied solo career has now entered its 40th year and covered various genres from blues to classical, as well as a significant number of albums widely regarded by many as bone-fide prog rock classics, so this is no small boast. Happily, it turns out to be exactly right.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Out Of The Body\n 02 - Wolflight\n 03 - Love Song To A Vampire\n 04 - The Wheel's Turning\n 05 - Corycian Fire\n 06 - Earthshine\n 07 - Loving Sea\n 08 - Black Thunder\n 09 - Dust And Dreams\n 10 - Heart Song\n 11 - Pneuma\n 12 - Midnight Sun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed43bab3db5b7a385611dd697df6b52fade0db37","amp;dn":"Steve+Hackett+-+Wolflight+%282015%29++BD-A+5.1%2B2.0+%5B24-48%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed43bab3db5b7a385611dd697df6b52fade0db37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,67,186,179,219,91,122,56,86,17,221,105,125,246,181,47,173,224,219,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
