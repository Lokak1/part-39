ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ngela Carne e Osso (ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ngela Meat and Bone) as performed by Helena Ignez (Sganzerla's wife, and muse/actress extraordinaire of both Cinema Novo and Cinema Marginal) is one of the most memorable female characters in Brazilian cinema. Variously introduced as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe woman of uncouth menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe queen of the Island of PleasuresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of the ten most.... megalomaniacsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, her motto being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI need all men, never stop loving themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. She is insouciant, insolent and impudent, one moment capturing the gaze of her assorted lovers (who include a playboy, an anarchist, a fake torero and a castaway from the Titanic!) with her alluring body and voice, the next being captured by their fractured masculinity and vanity. In fact she could be one of Vera ChytilovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡'s Daisies (1966) (or perhaps a parodic ersatz of Anna Karina's Godard roles) with whom she shares a love for pranks and a freewheeling attitude to life, things and men. But, alas, they all must be punished (ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ngela Carne e Osso by her own husband, the magnate Doktor Plirtz [JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ Soares]) as their independence and confident sexuality cannot be tolerated in totalitarian regimes (be it former Czechoslovakia or Brazil). Again, Sganzerla elucidates: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI wanted to show the neurotic, uncomfortable, difficult side of the modern woman (...) for the first time in our cinema, a woman sings, shouts, hits, kicks, dances, points fingers, has a devil of a time (...) (Helena Ignez) is Marlene Dietrich as co-directed by Mack Sennett and JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Mojica Marins, that is, by me...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: A mulher de todos 1969 Rogerio Sganzerla Helena Ignez Jo Soares Cinema Marginal Brasil.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 630,112,688 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:25:20\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.0\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 842 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.091 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n\n----***----\n\n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
