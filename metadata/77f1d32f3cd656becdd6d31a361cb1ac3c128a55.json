It is a devastating array of information about the U.S. role in the world, placed in the long historical perspective of the 500 years that followed the voyages of Columbus. The result is a wonderful single-volume education in history and world politics.&quot; - Howard Zinn &quot;This book portrays the world born five centuries ago: An immense supermarket where value is determined by price tags. What is the price of an intellectual? Chomsky's fierce talent proves once more that human beings are not condemned to become commodities.&quot; - Eduardo Galeano --This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Year-501-The-Conquest-Continues/dp/0896084442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372715587&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=year+501&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Year-501-The-Conquest-Continues/dp/0896084442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372715587&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=year+501&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f1d32f3cd656becdd6d31a361cb1ac3c128a55","amp;dn":"Year+501%3A+The+Conquest+Continues+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f1d32f3cd656becdd6d31a361cb1ac3c128a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,241,211,47,60,214,86,190,205,214,211,26,54,28,177,172,60,18,138,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
