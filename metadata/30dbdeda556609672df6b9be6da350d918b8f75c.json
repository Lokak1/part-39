Tyson: The Movie will take you on an incredible journey into the legendary boxer s life, from his days as a teenage drug dealer and thief in Brooklyn, New York to his meteoric rise to fame as the champion of the world and on to his shocking and outrageous decline.\n\nFor the first time in history, and in his own words, this unparalleled extremist takes you deep into his gritty world of crime, drug addiction and violence. Witness the monster fighting for his reputation and his very life while imprisoned for rape, tearing Evander Holyfield s ear off with his teeth and tasting defeat at the hands of Britain s Lennox Lewis... all before finally declaring bankruptcy and revealing the loss of a $400 million fortune.\n\nThe top of the world or the bottom of the ocean... there is no in-between. \n\nSynopsis\nDirector James Toback takes an unflinching, uncompromising look at the life of Mike Tyson--almost solely from the perspective of the man himself. TYSON alternates between the controversial boxer addressing the camera and shots of the champion's fights to create an arresting picture of the man.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nAudio : English DD5.1\n\nSubs  : none on disc\n\nBonus : Interview (15mn)\n\nMenu : Intact\n\nRemoved : Trailers, DD2.0, Logo\n\nRuntime : 87mns\n\nAR : 16/9\n\nPAL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30dbdeda556609672df6b9be6da350d918b8f75c","amp;dn":"Tyson+-The+Movie+%282008%29+DVDR+PAL-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30dbdeda556609672df6b9be6da350d918b8f75c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,219,222,218,85,102,9,103,45,246,185,190,109,163,80,217,24,184,247,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
