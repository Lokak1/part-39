King would allude to the album's title song in the 1990 revised and expanded edition of his novel The Stand, where a survivor of the novel's flu pandemic changes the lyrics to &quot;Flu made who.&quot; Three tracks on the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Who Made Who&quot; and the instrumentals &quot;D.T.&quot; and &quot;Chase the Ace&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were newly written and recorded by AC/DC. The rest were taken from the band's previous albums. Only one song, &quot;Ride On&quot;, is from the Bon Scott era; all of the others feature Brian Johnson. Who Made Who reached #11 in the UK and #33 in the US, and has sold five million copies in the US. It was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.\n\nAlong with the album, the band released a video tape which contained music videos for the songs &quot;Who Made Who&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot;, &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, and footage from a live performance of &quot;For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)&quot; which was filmed in Detroit in 1983\n\nAlbum\n\nAll songs written and composed by Malcolm Young, Angus Young and Brian Johnson, except where noted. \n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;Who Made Who&quot;   \t  \t3:27\n2. \t&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;   \t  \t3:30\n3. \t&quot;D.T.&quot; (Instrumental) \tM.
