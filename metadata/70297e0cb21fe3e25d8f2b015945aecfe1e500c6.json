Soon, their common history opens up when they are banned into the isolation cabin for unsocial behaviour.\nBeing twin sisters, their parents separated them at birth and divorced also. So, Annie grew up in London, England,\nliving with her mother Elizabeth, who is a wedding gown designer. Hallie lived with her father Nick, a vineyard-owner,\nin Napa Valley, California. Both sisters decide to switch sides, as Annie never had a father and Hallie never had a mother. \nAll works well, until Nick decides to marry Meredith, a creepy but beautiful woman who is only after his money.
