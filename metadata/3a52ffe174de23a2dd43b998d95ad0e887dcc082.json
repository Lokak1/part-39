Along with Lewis spewing his usual bile about the state of everything, Derek Edwards pontificates on his driving frustrations, Dom Irrera thinks alcohol is wonderful, Kathleen Madigan has lost all hope for America, Greg Giraldo rants on about how women have all the power today, and Paul F Tompkins has probably the most incendiary topic of all. You'd be an idiot to miss it... then again, that's just our opinion.\n\nFormat : AVI\nLength : 423 MiB for 44mn 57s 888ms\nSource : CBC HD\nCodec : DivX\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 172 Kbps\nAspect : 640 x 360 (1.778) at 29.969 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a52ffe174de23a2dd43b998d95ad0e887dcc082","amp;dn":"Just+for+Laughs.Show+%232.11.Oct.2010.HDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a52ffe174de23a2dd43b998d95ad0e887dcc082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,82,255,225,116,222,35,162,221,67,185,152,217,90,208,232,135,220,192,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
