Craig Winn uses the context of the Hadith to illuminate the Quran, the incredible messy nature of the 'divine' revelations Muhammed supposedly received from Allah. \n\nIt proceeds into showing how the scriptures motivate the Mujahedeen, the Jihad movement and modern-day terrorists, as well as the dhimmi system and the general spirit of submission that permeates Islam. \n\nWhile the book deals with scripture and serious issue, the dry humour of the author makes this hilarious reading. Unless you're an imam, in which case you'll probably detonate with fury for having your knowledge revealed.\n\nThis is a long (almost 1000 pages) book, downloaded from the web site of the authorIt is a rich source of original quotations and well worth it if you're interested in revealing fundamentalist Islam.\n\nThe book is out of print, and the author makes the original pdf freely downloadable from his web site. Please distribute widely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8fbfcf68665489fa84d43e6ba6682c0b1531078","amp;dn":"Prophet+of+Doom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8fbfcf68665489fa84d43e6ba6682c0b1531078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,251,252,246,134,101,72,159,168,77,67,230,186,102,130,192,177,83,16,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
