The continuity, while following elements from the cartoon series of the same name, was wholly its own continuity. Differences included the Mini-Cons' ability to talk in a normal way rather than the beeps and boops from the cartoon series. Also, the resolution to the Armada saga was quite different and involved cross-dimensional travel and several Generation 1 characters.\n\nMore info: http://www.comicvine.com/transformers-armada/49-10849/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cea844a26042feaf6e12e41095368bd57d814077","amp;dn":"Transformers+-+Armada+%28Complete%29+%28Continues+in+Energon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cea844a26042feaf6e12e41095368bd57d814077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,168,68,162,96,66,254,175,110,18,228,16,149,54,139,213,125,129,64,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
