Then, Homer is intent on making sure the whole family enjoys and stays awake for the Springfield Holiday Parade. And when the Duff Cola polar bears escape from their float, the Springfield Bear Patrol must spring into action! Finally, after squandering all the holiday gift money again, Homer resorts a do-it-yourself Christmas much to his family's dismay.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3af9c83d344e651e7c5a64b0b36936983e6f0500","amp;dn":"Simpsons+Winter+Wingding+Issue+8+%28PDF%29+-+Nov+20+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3af9c83d344e651e7c5a64b0b36936983e6f0500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,249,200,61,52,78,101,30,124,90,100,176,179,105,54,152,62,111,5,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
