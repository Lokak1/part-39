If she could not perform on the Olympic stage, Sunny found another stage to perform on - even if it was at a gentlemen's club. Overnight, Sunny became extremely popular and was later named Deja Vu's Showgirl of the Year in 2004.\nIt was through her dancing, that Sunny's path would cross with world famous adult star Ron Jeremy and Bunny Ranch owner Dennis Hof. Quickly the Showgirl of the Year was appearing on household televisions everywhere on HBO's now infamous reality television show 'Cathouse'. In 2005, Sunny was named Nightmoves Calendar Cover Girl. Nightmoves sent Sunny to the AVN's in 2005 and was approached by Sean Michaels to shoot. Playboy also came calling asking Sunny to appear as a regular on Playboy radio, do various Playboy shows and ultimately to feature in Playboy Magazine's Lingerie Issue - the Women of Playboy TV, February 2006. In a whirlwind, Sunny started shooting adult movies (and was recognized immediately for her efforts with 2006 AVN nominations for Best New Starlet and Best Actress for Dark Angels 2 Bloodlines).\n\n\nAWARDS LIST:\n\nBooble Girl of the Year!
