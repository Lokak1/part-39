Peter Grant, who, in years prior, was a key component of fellow British \nrock band Led Zeppelin's rise to fame, managed the band. Bad Company enjoyed great success throughout the \n1970s. Many of their singles, such as &quot;Bad Company&quot; &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot; &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot; and \n&quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;, retain popularity with rockers of both the past and present decades. To this day, \ntheir songs remain staples of classic rock radio.\nBad Company is the eponymous debut studio album by hard rock band Bad Company.\n\nThe album was recorded at Headley Grange with Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio in November 1973.\n\nThe album peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200. Since then the album has sold in excess of five million copies\nand has become the 46th best selling album of the 70s. The album spent 25 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, \nentering at #10 and reaching its highest position of #3 in the second week.[6] Kerrang! magazine listed \nthe album at No. 40 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.\n\nThe singles &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Movin' On&quot; peaked at #5 and #19 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. \n&quot;Rock Steady&quot;, &quot;Bad Company&quot; and &quot;Ready for Love&quot; (the latter originally recorded by guitarist Mick Ralphs \nduring his tenure with Mott the Hoople on All the Young Dudes) are also &quot;classic rock&quot; radio staples.\n\nIn 2006 a limited edition CD of 24K Gold was released.
