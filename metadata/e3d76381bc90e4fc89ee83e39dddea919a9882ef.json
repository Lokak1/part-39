to pay the same price or even more for other\n        software that has only a small fraction of Auction Auto Bidder's\n        features, is harder to use, or isn't reliable? Many people are\n        switching to Auction Auto Bidder after trying the others, make\n        the right choice now and save your money. With the 60 day\n        satisfaction guarantee, you have nothing to loose.\n\n        Why snipe (bid in the last seconds) rather than use eBay's\n        proxy-bidding?\n\n        Ã‚Â· Win items at a lower cost since no one will have time to outbid\n          you, if you bid a long time before the end, eBay will email the\n          previous high bidder to let them know they've been outbid so\n          they will most likely come back and outbid you causing the\n          price to increase, this software prevents this and often pays\n          for itself on the first use\n        Ã‚Â· Increase your chances of winning since people wont have time to\n          outbid you\n        Ã‚Â· You can decide to remove your bid up to the last minute since\n          it is only sent to eBay in the last seconds\n\n        Also works as a fully featured web browser optimized to make\n        browsing eBay faster &amp; easier.\n\n        What are bid groups?\n\n        With bid groups, you can find several listings of an item you\n        want, add them all to be sniped and place them in a group. Place\n        bids from lowest to highest for the auction ending the soonest to\n        the latest respectively (for example, a $30 bid on the listing\n        ending in 2 hours, a $35 on the one ending in 17 hours, and a $40\n        on the one ending in 1 day). By doing this, the software will\n        attempt to win the first one at your lowest bid, if it wins, all\n        other bids in the group are canceled, if you're outbid, it will\n        try to win the second one and so on. This can double your savings\n        compared to using only normal sniping and saves you even more\n        time!\n\n        Very easy to use\n\n        Auction Auto Bidder is so simple to use that anyone, including\n        novice computer users can be using it within minutes without even\n        having to read instructions, thanks to the user friendly\n        interface and wizards which make installing and setting up a\n        snipe as simple as entering your maximum bid! Auction Auto Bidder\n        will automatically retrieve the item details and do the rest.\n\n        Ã‚Â· Set event notifications for items (new bids, available quantity\n          changes, specified amount of time left, price exceeds specified\n          amount)\n        Ã‚Â· Notifications of sellers with poor feedback or who do not\n          accept PayPal in built in browser\n        Ã‚Â· Import watched auctions from &quot;my eBay&quot;\n        Ã‚Â· Bid group support (group several auctions of an item you want,\n          and the software will automatically attempt to win one after\n          the other in the group until one of them is won at your maximum\n          bid or less, and then cancels the bids on the other items in\n          the group, this prevents you from having to wait and see if you\n          are outbid and then find another item)\n        Ã‚Â· Built in tabbed web browser (open multiple web pages and switch\n          between them in a single click)\n        Ã‚Â· Shipping cost shown in item list\n        Ã‚Â· Favorites menu allows you to add your favorite pages such as\n          searches, sellers, or any other webpage\n        Ã‚Â· New easier to use interactive items list with one click access\n          to all options\n        Ã‚Â· Powerful list filter option allows you to apply one or more\n          filters too see only the items you want (bidding, won, ended,\n          etc. including any combination)\n        Ã‚Â· Fully supports using international eBay websites\n        Ã‚Â· Ability to leave notes for items\n        Ã‚Â· Three view modes (list &amp;

Just make sure its not updating anything from\n        EBAY (check the bottom right update notification area and the\n        blue updating bar is gone) when you tried and then click exit\n        under the file menu again.  This usually always works, click exit\n        a few times if needed.  Its best to close down the client\n        properly as you don't want corrupted data or the popup nag about\n        the program not closing properly when restarted.\n\n        Thats it!
