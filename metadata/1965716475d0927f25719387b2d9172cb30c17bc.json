Directed by John Huston, it was produced by Gottfried Reinhardt with Dore Schary as executive producer. The screenplay is by John Huston, adapted by Albert Band from Stephen Crane's novel of the same name. The cinematography is by Harold Rosson, and the music score by Bronislau Kaper. The making of the film is the subject of Lillian Ross's 1952 book Picture, originally in The New Yorker.\n\nThe American Civil War film is a sparse but faithful retelling of the story, incorporating narration from the text to move the plot forward. Audie Murphy, a hero of World War II who later went into acting, played the lead role of Henry Fleming. Other actors include cartoonist Bill Mauldin, Andy Devine, Arthur Hunnicutt and Royal Dano.\n\nTorrent includes the 1951 film, two audiobook unabridged versions, the text of the novel, Cliffs notes from the website and PDF scan of the full notes, and Sparks Notes.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1965716475d0927f25719387b2d9172cb30c17bc","amp;dn":"The+Red+Badge+of+Courage+%28Film%2C+Audiobook%2C+Cliffs+Notes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1965716475d0927f25719387b2d9172cb30c17bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,101,113,100,117,208,146,127,37,113,147,135,178,217,23,44,179,12,23,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
