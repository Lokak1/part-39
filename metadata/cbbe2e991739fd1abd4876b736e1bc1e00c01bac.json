Shepp, who was nearing the end of his free jazz period (soon he would be exploring hymns and traditional melodies) puts a lot of emotion into &quot;Lush Life&quot; and sounds fine on originals by Burrell and Greenlee in addition to his own &quot;U-jamsa.&quot; A worthy effort. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nArchie Shepp (Tenor Saxophone) \nCharles Majid Greenlee (Trombone) \nDave Burrell (Piano) \nCameron Brown (Double Bass) \nBeaver Harris (Drums) \n\nArchie Shepp - Montreux One Tracks:\n01  Lush Life (Billy Straihorn) 12:38 \n02  U-Jamaa (Archie Shepp) 10:22 \n03  Crucificado (Dave Burrell) 11:43 \n04  Miss Toni (Charles Majid Greenlee) 11:58 \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbbe2e991739fd1abd4876b736e1bc1e00c01bac","amp;dn":"Archie+Shepp+-+Montreux+One+%281975%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbbe2e991739fd1abd4876b736e1bc1e00c01bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,190,46,153,23,57,253,26,189,72,118,183,54,225,188,30,0,192,27,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
