Just read the track listing...this is nearly perfect.\n\nConfession: I don't own this album, but looking at the songs included, it's enough to make any serious metal fan wet themselves with glee. I own every record represented on here, and Living Death aside (plus, a better Sodom track surely could have been chosen) this is amazingly solid. Great to see Destructor and Brainfever represented...two bands who deserve more props!\n\nWhen you listen to this, you can see why some of these bands made it and are still remembered today, and some are forgotten. The albums highlights are tracks A3 through A6, which when you drop the needle on the record take you on a ride from the dark primitive Bathory, through the soaring heights of Helloween's falsetto vocals, and then into a diabolical thrash-fest with classic tracks from Living Death and Sodom.\n\nDamn good selection of stuff. Death, Possessed, Bathory, Holy Terror, Dark Angel, Onslaught and Nuclear Assault all contribute classics, while the rest are at least very good. Anyone remember English Dogs? This is a good track from their WHERE LEGEND BEGAN album, the their preceding EP METALMORPHOSIS EP was equally great.\n\nVolume 4 (1989 UK 16-track Under One Flag label double LP compilation featuring material from Exodus Re-Animator Blind Illusion Acid Reign Death Bathory and more comes in a gatefold picture sleeve.The sleeve has some minor storage wear mostly on the edges whilst the vinyl is in excellent condition FLAG33)\nMost items in our store will be better than Very Good condition (also referred to as excellent) - the majority of items are nearer Like New which is the equivalent of a Mint grading.
