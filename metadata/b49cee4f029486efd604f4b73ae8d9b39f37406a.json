Two thousand people, all civilians, got killed. Like millions all over the world, Pablo Picasso was shocked and he translated his emotion into a magnificent but terrifying picture bearing the name of the martyred city. This film does not only comment on the painting, it also gives it a new life through frantic camera and sound effects. \n\nwww.makingoff.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b49cee4f029486efd604f4b73ae8d9b39f37406a","amp;dn":"Alain+Resnais+-+guernica+-+1950+Eng.+And+portuguese+subtitle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b49cee4f029486efd604f4b73ae8d9b39f37406a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,156,238,79,2,148,134,239,214,4,244,183,58,232,217,179,159,55,64,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
