This release 2004 on Original Jazz Classics.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nHawkins was one of the main inspirations of his fellow tenor Eddie \\&quot;Lockjaw\\&quot; Davis, so it was logical that they would one day meet up in the recording studio. This CD has many fine moments from these two highly competitive jazzmen, particularly the lengthy title cut and a heated tradeoff on \\&quot;In a Mellow Tone,\\&quot; on which Davis goes higher but Hawkins wins on ideas. \n\nColeman Hawkins &amp; Eddie \\'Lockjaw\\' Davis - Tenor\nTommy Flanagan - Piano\nRon Carter - Bass\nGus Johnson - Drums\n\n01.
