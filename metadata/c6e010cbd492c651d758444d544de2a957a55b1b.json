Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL Licence.\n\nBased on a powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendlyness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.\n\nThis project is mature. However, there may be still some bugs and missing features that are being worked on. If you have any questions or suggestions about this project, please post them in the forums. Also, if you wish to make a feature request, you can post it there as well. But there's no guarantee that I'll implement your request.\n\nI hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.\n\n\nHere are the features of Notepad++ :\t\n\nSyntax Highlighting and Syntax Folding \n\n\nSupported languages : \t\nC\nC++\nJava\nC#\nXML\nHTML\nPHP\nCSS\nmakefile\nASCII art (.nfo)\ndoxygen\t\nini file\nbatch file\nJavascript\nASP\nVB/VBS\nSQL\nObjective-C\nRC resource file\nPascal\nPerl\nPython\nLua\nTeX\nTCL\nAssembler\nRuby\nLisp\nScheme\nProperties\nDiff\nSmalltalk\nPostscript\nVHDL\nAda\nCaml\nAutoIt\nKiXtart\nMatlab\nVerilog\nHaskell\nInnoSetup\nCMake\nYAML\n\n\nWYSIWYG \n\n\nIf you have a colour printer, print your source code (or whatever you want) in colour. \n\n\nUser Defined Syntax Highlighting \n\n\nIt allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, comment keywords and the operators.\n\n\nAuto-completion \n\n\nFor most supported languages, user can make his/her own API list. Once the api file is ready, type Ctrl+Space to launch this action.\n\n\nMulti-Document \n\n\nYou can edit several documents at the same time. \n\n\nMulti-View \n\n\nYou have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2 different documents at the same time. You can visualize (edit) in the 2 views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modification of document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modify the SAME document when you are in clone mode). \n\n\nRegular Expression Search/Replace supported \n\n\nYou can search and replace one string in the document by using the regular expression. \n\n\nFull Drag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“N' Drop supported \n\n\nYou can open a document by drag &amp; drop. You can also move your document from a position (or even a view) to another by drag &amp; drop. \n\n\nDynamic position of Views \n\n\nThe user can set the position of the views dynamically (only in 2 views mode : the splitter can be set in horizontal or in vertical). \n\n\nFile Status Auto-detection \n\n\nIf you modify or delete a file which opened in Notepad++, you will be notified to update your document (reload the file or remove the file). \n\n\nZoom in and zoom out \n\n\nThat's another fantastic function of Scintilla component.\n\n\nMulti-Language environment supported \n\n\nThe Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hebrew Windows environments are supported.\n\n\nBookmark \n\n\nUser can just click on the bookmark margin (located right side of line number margin) or type Ctrl+F2 to toggle a book mark. To reach the bookmark, type just F2 (Next bookmark) or Shift+F2 (Previous bookmark). To clear all bookmarks, click the Menu Search-&gt;Clear All bookmarks.\n\n\nBrace and Indent guideline Highlighting \n\n\nWhen the caret stay beside of one of those symbol { } [ ] ( ) , the symbol beside of caret and its symmetric opposite symbol will be highlighted, as well as the indent guideline (if any) in order to locate the block more easily.\n\n\nMacro recording and playback \n\n\nYou can save several macros and edit their keyboard shorcuts for the next use.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nFix Function Tip crash issue.\n\nFix the find in files crash bug while cloned views are side by side and focus is on main view.\n\nFix a crash bug after searching/replacing in files returned with no results.\n\nEnhance &quot;Find in all opened files&quot; and &quot;Find in files&quot; features.\n\nAdd Replace in files feature.\n\nFix command line parsing to accept unquoted files as single argument.\n\nRefine &quot;open ANSI files as UTF8 w/o BOM&quot; feature.\n\nAdd minidump feature in the case of crash for debug use. \n\nAdjust PostIt/FullScreen behaviour to mix well together.\n\nThe file filters and the directory are set while find/replace/findInFiles dialog is launched.\n\nAdding find in files filters supports user defined language.\n\nFix the bug that texts in combo box of Find dialog are restored not in order on the launch time.\n\nAdd NPPM_DOOPEN plugin message.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6e010cbd492c651d758444d544de2a957a55b1b","amp;dn":"Notepad%2B%2B+5.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6e010cbd492c651d758444d544de2a957a55b1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,224,16,203,212,146,198,81,215,88,68,77,84,77,226,169,87,165,91,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
