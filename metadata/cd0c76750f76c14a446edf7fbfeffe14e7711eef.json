If it's set to 1, it marks the private torrent\nbit in the byte shown above, which forces the other information in this byte\nto be ignored.\n\nThis byte is also saved in the resume.dat file (a bencoded file that uTorrent\nuses to save its state) as an integer value named &quot;dht&quot;.\n\nThe patch works by storing the private torrent flag in bit 7 instead of bit 1\nso that all the code in uTorrent that checks bit 1 to determine if this is a\nprivate torrent will always find that it isn't. However, it writes the &quot;dht&quot;\nvalue out to the resume.dat normally, so if you start an unpatched copy of\nuTorrent your private torrents will still be private.\n\nThe extra code to do this is placed at the end of the .text segment and its\nvirtual size increased accordingly.\n\n\nReproducing the patch\n---------------------\n\nHere are the steps required to apply the patch; you will need UPX version 3.03\nand a hex editor:\n\n 1. Decompress the uTorrent.exe file using the following command:\n\n     upx -d uTorrent.exe\n     \n 2. Open the uTorrent.exe file in a hex editor and change the following:\n\n     position  old bytes                new bytes\n     --------  ------------------------ ------------------------\n          200  BC                       E8\n         530B  50 68 0C CB 45 00        E9 AC 5F 05 00 90\n         8574  02                       80\n         BCEC  8A 4E 41 80 E1 F7        E9 E0 F5 04 00 90\n        5B2BC  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  8B C8 80 E1 80 C1 E9 06\n               00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  0B C1 50 68 0C BB 45 00\n               00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  E9 3F A0 FA FF 8B C8 80\n               00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  E1 02 C0 E9 06 24 FD 0B\n               00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  C1 8A 4E 41 80 E1 0A E9\n               00 00 00 00              09 0A FB FF\n\n 3. The digital signature is now invalid. Remove it from the file by deleting\n    everything after position 8F000.\n   \n 4. Recompress the file using this command:\n\n     upx --ultra-brute uTorrent.exe\n     \n 5. This will produce a file of size 267264 bytes. The patch is now complete\n    and should be identical to the file in this torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0c76750f76c14a446edf7fbfeffe14e7711eef","amp;dn":"uTorrent+1.8.2+build+15167+with+DHT+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0c76750f76c14a446edf7fbfeffe14e7711eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,12,118,117,15,118,193,74,68,110,223,127,191,239,254,20,231,113,30,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
