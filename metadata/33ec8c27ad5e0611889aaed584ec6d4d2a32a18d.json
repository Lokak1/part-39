The band had some hit singles such as &quot;Stranglehold&quot;, &quot;Warhead&quot;, &quot;Teenage&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow's Girls&quot;, with several of their songs managing to enter the United Kingdom's Top Forty.\n\nTracklist:\n\n    All songs written by Nicky Garratt and Charlie Harper.\n\nNo. \tTitle\n\n01. \t&quot;C.I.D.&quot;\n02. \t&quot;I Couldn't be You&quot;\n03. \t&quot;I Live in a Car&quot;\n04. \t&quot;Tomorrows Girls&quot;\n05. \t&quot;Killer&quot;\n06. \t&quot;World War&quot;\n07. \t&quot;Rockers&quot;\n08. \t&quot;I.O.D.&quot;\n09. \t&quot;T.V.
