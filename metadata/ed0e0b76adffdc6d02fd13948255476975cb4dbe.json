However, in this new work the visual component, based on the traditions of Russian impressionism, is even more active. The black and white image is far closer to a monochrome water-colour as the creators never forget to soften the black deepness of shadows.\n\nAs far as its dramatic intonation is concerned, Stone is undoubtedly a Russian film, but not only due to the fact that we can recognize Anton Chekhov in one of the characters and not only because the action takes place in the house where a famous Russian family once lived.\n\nThis is a profoundly lyrical film because of its special \\'chamber\\' atmosphere and the modesty of emotions: quiet intonations, permanent sadness, and a feeling of the deeply tragic nature of life. Stone is a film that would never search for the audience: its voice is too quiet. This film will meet with its audience only if the audience searches for it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6285/kamennt1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6285/kamennt1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------not my rip-------\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 780,512,886 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:24:03\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: DivX 5.x/6.x\nFrame Size ......................................: 636x480 (AR: 1.325)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1100 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.144 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n**********************************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
