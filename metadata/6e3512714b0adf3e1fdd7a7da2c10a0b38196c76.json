Included with the pro footage is my own multicam from YouTube footage to complete this unedited concert. The audio is a lossless\nrip of the audio shared here: http://www.queenzone.com/forums/1396210/queen-music-download-announce-q-and-al-2014-08-17-summer-sonic-2014-tokyo-japan-flac.aspx\nThe YT footage from me is a new edit in comparison to the older share too, with more stable footage and better shots added, so if you have the V1 I would recommend getting this too.\n\nThank you to all who contributed video and audio to this truly community project.\n\nProduced By Marknow\n\nFilmed By:\n\nmmyy9:\nkesamoenoi \n518MT\nshirotopooh\nes2012v\nriddle601\nvamglam76\n\n1.
