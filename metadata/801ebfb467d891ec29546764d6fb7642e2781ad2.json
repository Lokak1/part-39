Christopher Stevens and three other American diplomats. Although the vicious attack was initially reported as a protest against an anti-Islamic video, later evidence suggested that it may have been a coordinated terrorist attackÃ¢â‚¬â€perhaps even tied to al-Qaeda. This begged the question: Did the White House brush off a terrorist attack in order to save face? Since then, the incident has developed into a full-blown partisan debate over whether the government was involved in a cover-up or not, and worse, whether the attack could have been prevented.\n\nThe Benghazi Report is the Senate committeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s findingsÃ¢â‚¬â€the culmination of over a yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of investigations and interviews, presented in full. Readers of The Benghazi Report will find many of the revelations shocking. Did the White House manipulate the facts? Why was the disclosure of information so unnecessarily slow? What is the connection between the mysterious deaths of fifteen Libyans who had been assisting the FBIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation and a trail of incompetence left by foreign governments unwilling cooperate? Were the attacks were preventable?\n\nFeaturing an introduction by bestselling author Roger Stone, this report represents a landmark in the ongoing struggle for more transparency from the U.S. government.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nRoger Stone is the author of the New York Times bestseller The Man Who Killed Kennedy.
