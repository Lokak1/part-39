On the surface, Nick Bellamy looks like any other veteran retiree left behind by a modern world. In reality, Nick is a former enforcer, who stole a fortune and years of freedom from his former mob boss. Now, in the twilight of his life, Nick will lose everything he cares about except two things: revenge... and the chance to die with his guns blazing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707a73f016d8cae997beea030d6f5767122f5019","amp;dn":"Sunset+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707a73f016d8cae997beea030d6f5767122f5019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,122,115,240,22,216,202,233,151,190,234,3,13,111,87,103,18,47,80,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
