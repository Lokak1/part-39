But the blood bath the new Major Crimes deputy chief finds at a murder scene is beyond even the savagery of Eric Spears, the serial killer who now haunts Jess's life with terrifying text messages. Amid eerie echoes of the Charles Manson massacre, Jess investigates the dismemberment of a cop's wife while her baby lay sleeping down the hall.\n\nThe discovery of two more headless victims makes Jess wonder if it's a gang-related slaying, a personal vendetta . . . or something else. And the sudden reappearance of her ex-husband makes her question her future with Chief of Police Dan Burnett. Now as the net widens to include a shocking suspect, Jess realizes that the identity of the killer may lie with an autistic eight-year-old boy. With inner-city tensions at an all-time high and the community calling for blood, Jess must race to save an innocent child-and prevent a final, horrifying act of rage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8159b1a35d5025db7d7ff110b6dbaefe1a311bb","amp;dn":"Rage+-+%5BFaces+of+Evil%2C+%234%5D+-+Debra+Webb.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8159b1a35d5025db7d7ff110b6dbaefe1a311bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,21,155,26,53,213,2,93,183,215,255,17,11,109,186,239,225,163,17,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
