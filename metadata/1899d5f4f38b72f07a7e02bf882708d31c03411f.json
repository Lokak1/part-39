What he lacks in detail he more than makes up for by writing in an accessible, straight-forward prose that doesn't require a Master's Degree in Art History to be understood. He provides numerous illustrations, many of which (unfortunately) are not in color, and he also touches on major accomplishments in architecture and landscape design. This book is a great introduction for anyone interested in a study of 18th cent. art or even for the curious layman, but it is probably too general for serious researchers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1899d5f4f38b72f07a7e02bf882708d31c03411f","amp;dn":"The+18th+Century+%28Cambridge+History+of+Art%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1899d5f4f38b72f07a7e02bf882708d31c03411f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,153,213,244,243,139,114,240,122,126,2,191,136,39,8,211,28,3,65,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
