Hagmann, founder and director of the Northeast Intelligence Network. He is also the CEO of a private investigative agency serving a roster of Fortune 500 clients. Due to his expertise in covert surveillance and counter-terrorism, Mr. Hagmann has been used as an operational asset by the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, as well as the Pennsylvania and New York State Police agencies. Earlier this month, Doug said high-level, reliable sources told him the Department of Homeland Security is preparing for Ã¢â‚¬Å“massive civil warÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in America as a result of a collapse of the dollar and the hyperinflation that will result. \n\nAlex also continues his coverage of the Army's re-education camps and the upcoming Bilderberg confab in Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
