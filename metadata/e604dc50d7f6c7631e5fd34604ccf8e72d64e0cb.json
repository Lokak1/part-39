Beep Me lets you do so quickly and easily. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste time using the calendar to add an event or using the clock to create a new alarm. With Beep Me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just two simple steps: Jot a short memo, and set the beep time. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all! \n\nIn a meeting when you remember that you promised to return a call in the afternoon? Jot down Ã¢â‚¬Å“call JackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and set it to beep you at 2:30. Put the pizza in the oven and need to set a timer? Jot Ã¢â‚¬Å“pizzaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and set it to beep you in 20 minutes. \n\nWant your calendar events to appear at the same central reminder app and benefit from the nagging and pre-alarms that are available only in Beep Me? No problem, just select the calendars you'd like to import from and you're ready to go.\n\nDo you have more than one device? keep that synced with the new Backup &amp; Restore options using SugarSync or Dropbox clouds.\nJust backup your Beeps from one device and Restore them on another device, importing only the missing Beeps on that device.\n\nFrom the reviews: \n* &quot;Simple, easy to use, works very well.
