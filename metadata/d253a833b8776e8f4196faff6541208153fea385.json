Although great advances have been made in the study of the architectural design of agent systems, the complexity and multi-disciplinary approaches of this constantly growing field are currently of a premature nature compared to where they should be. Architectural Design of Multi-Agent Systems: Technologies and Techniques provides a compilation of advanced research results focusing on architecture and modeling issues of multi-agent systems. This study serves as a reference for further research on system models, architectural design languages, formal methods and reasoning, module interface design, and design issues. Architectural Design of Multi-Agent Systems: Technologies and Techniques presents high-level issues such as: modeling agent systems in cognitive sciences, knowledge management, in-depth exposure of agent theory, and state-of-the-art research on design quality of agent systems.\nAbout the Author\nHong Lin received his PhD degree in computer science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1997. He is currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Houston-Downtown and the chairperson of the Computer Science Curriculum Committee. His research interests include multi-agent systems, parallel/distributed computing, and formal methods. He has recently studied the application of the chemical reaction model in multi-agent system specification and derivation. His research results have been published in several papers in professional journals and conference proceedings.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 421 pages\n    * Publisher: IGI Global; 1 edition (May 31, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1599041081\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1599041087","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d253a833b8776e8f4196faff6541208153fea385","amp;dn":"Architectural+Design+of+Multi+Agent+Systems%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d253a833b8776e8f4196faff6541208153fea385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,83,168,51,184,119,110,143,65,150,250,255,101,65,32,129,83,254,163,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
