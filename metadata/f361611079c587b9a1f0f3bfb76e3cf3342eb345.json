Avalon was the first of the manufactured teen idols, before Fabian and Bobby Rydell and the myriads of other pretenders to the throne who worked the turf with tight black pants and red, red sweaters to the fore while Elvis cooled his heels in Germany. In the late '50s and early '60s, post-Twist and pre-Beatles, these generally untalented pretty boys were the cardboard no-threat remnants of a post-Elvis age. But Avalon had a real musical background to go with the pretty boy looks, and was no drugstore teenager waiting to be discovered. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:g9fuxqq5ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:g9fuxqq5ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nAnother excellent entry in See for Miles' EP series, here's 28 of Avalon's sides for the Chancellor label pulled from various extended-play 45 albums issued in England, Sweden, and France. It's an interesting compendium of hits, B-sides, and album filler ranging from early rockers like &quot;Dede Dinah&quot; and &quot;Gingerbread&quot; to schmaltzy teen fare like &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;Bobby Sox to Stockings.&quot; Although not a greatest hits package, it's pretty much all the Frankie Avalon you'll ever need for your collection.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:kvftxq8kldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:kvftxq8kldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
