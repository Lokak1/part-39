They have achieved considerable fame through the large numbers of memoirs written by members of the rifle corps as well as through modern fiction, most notably the Sharpe series. Apart from their reputation as a corps d'elite, the riflemen were, in their time, at the very cutting edge of military technology and tactical theory. Philip Haythornwaite here uses fascinating first hand accounts and detailed research to give a 'soldier's-eye view' of the British Rifleman, his life and work.\n\n# Publisher \tOsprey Publishing (April 25, 2002)\n# Language \tEnglish\n# ISBN-10 \t184176177X\n# ISBN-13 \t978-1841761770","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff99ace12e6b5913880acc18efb2597d9b5c4fb","amp;dn":"British+Rifleman+1797-1815+%28Warrior%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff99ace12e6b5913880acc18efb2597d9b5c4fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,249,154,206,18,230,181,145,56,128,172,193,142,251,37,151,217,181,196,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
