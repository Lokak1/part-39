Schuyler has such a soft voice but mixed with such bold songwriting, she keeps her listeners captivated. The second track, &quot;Like A Fool&quot; is a sad song and yet it is a very fun song to sing along to and an even more fun song to interpret and relate to.\n\n\n&quot;What If I Leave&quot; brings back those memories from being on the brink of a break up and all of the &quot;What Ifs&quot; come to mind. We've all had these moments and if you're currently in this situation, this somber song will probably make you cry. &quot;Tell Your Heart&quot; is a song that someone resisting love may not want to hear but should if they know in their heart that they share the same feelings with that special someone. It's a song of reassurance and there aren't too many songs out like this so it is one to be cherished.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a694ec3723efa76489dd643329b425ed60a3067b","amp;dn":"Schuyler+Fisk+-+Blue+Ribbon+Winner+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a694ec3723efa76489dd643329b425ed60a3067b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,148,236,55,35,239,167,100,137,221,100,51,41,180,37,237,96,163,6,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
