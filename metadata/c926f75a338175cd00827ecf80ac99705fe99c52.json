The original pairing of Sam Moore and Dave Prater met in Florida in 1961, and they recorded unsuccessfully for several years before being signed to Atlantic Records in 1965. Atlantic persuaded their Memphis affiliate Stax Records to produce them, and in December that year the writing and production team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter delivered the crisply soulful &quot;You Don't Know Like I Know.&quot; Hayes and Porter became the ÃƒÂ©minence grises behind Sam &amp; Dave, much as Holland-Dozier-Holland pulled the strings behind the Supremes. They wrote, they produced -- and the result was a string of hits, including &quot;Soul Man,&quot; &quot;Hold On! I'm Comin',&quot; and &quot;I Thank You,&quot; songs that survive as the very epitome of Southern soul. Certainly, Sam &amp; Dave's hits are among the most soulful ever to crack the Hot 100. Their albums often bore the hallmarks of hasty execution, though. The dissolution of the partnership between Stax and Atlantic virtually sealed the fate of Sam &amp; Dave; there were a few more hits (and, later, a revival of interest thanks to the Blues Brothers), but the glory days were over.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sam-dave-p5344/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sam-dave-p5344/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KCZ9JU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KCZ9JU&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
