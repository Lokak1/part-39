In the\n            trenches between the burial mounds hundreds of dead soldiers\n            sat side by side with their heads against the torn earth,as\n            if they had fallen asleep together in a deep dream of war.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  \n\n\n                           Empire Of The Sun\n========================================================================================================================================================================\n \nThe classic, award-winning novel, made famous by Steven Spielberg's film, tells of a young boy's struggle to survive World War II in China.\n\nJim is separated from his parents in a world at war. To survive, he must find a strength greater than all the events that surround him.\n\nShanghai, 1941 -- a city aflame from the fateful torch of Pearl Harbor. In streets full of chaos and corpses, a young British boy searches in vain for his parents. Imprisoned in a Japanese concentration camp, he is witness to the fierce white flash of Nagasaki, as the bomb bellows the end of the war...and the dawn of a blighted world.\n\nBallard's enduring novel of war and deprivation, internment camps and death marches, and starvation and survival is an honest coming-of-age tale set in a world thrown utterly out of joint.\n\n==============\nJames Graham &quot;J. G.&quot; Ballard (15 November 1930 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 19 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist.\n\nBallard came to be associated with the New Wave of science fiction early in his career with apocalyptic (or post-apocalyptic) novels such as The Drowned World (1962), The Burning World (1964), and The Crystal World (1966). In the late 1960s and early 1970s Ballard focused on an eclectic variety of short stories (or &quot;condensed novels&quot;) such as The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), which drew closer comparison with the work of postmodernist writers such as William S. Burroughs. \n\nThe literary distinctiveness of Ballard's work has given rise to the adjective &quot;Ballardian&quot;, defined by the Collins English Dictionary as &quot;resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments.&quot; The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry describes Ballard's work as being occupied with &quot;eros, thanatos, mass media and emergent technologies&quot;.\n===========================================================\nBook Details::\nISBN:978-0743265232\nPages:164 in SumatraPdf\nPublisher:Harper\t\nYear:2006\n===========================================================\nPart of JG Ballard collection\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66f834bcde6fe110c15f8286ea6c85639ea37eef","amp;dn":"Empire+of+the+Sun+By+J+G+Ballard+%28EPUB%2CMOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66f834bcde6fe110c15f8286ea6c85639ea37eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,248,52,188,222,111,225,16,193,95,130,134,234,108,133,99,158,163,126,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
