Ranging over American intervention in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America since WWII, Chomsky deftly sketches the logic behind our foreign policy, and its tragic results around the globe and at home. Whether it's globalization, oil, or a monopoly on real terror, it's business as usual, and we-not to mention the rest of the world-have to pay. Now more than ever, the venerable professor stands as the voice of reason in an apparently insane world.\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the ''most cited living author''. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 1:17:00\n\n\n1  Historical significance of 9-11\n2  Latin American Victims Of tate Terror Respond to 911\n3  Turkey And Reppression  \n4  The U.S. Lebanon And Israel\n5  Wars On Terror, Old And New-And Orwellian Doublespeak\n6  Israel, The U.S. And The Geneva Convention  \n7  Good Terrorists, Bad Terrorists And Monied Muslims\n8  Why Do They Hate Us? - Pouring Oil On Troubled Waters - Then And Now\n9  Latin America, The U.S. And Glaobalisation\n10 Same Forgien Policy, Same Armaments-Different Pretext\n11 The Problems With Iraq\n12 Middle East: Maps, Plans And Peace  \n13 Justice And The Emerging Framework\n14 Venezuela, Coups And Democracy\n15 Peace, Land And The West Bank  \n16 China: U.S. Hopes And Fears  \t\n17 U.S.The Impediment To Peace In The Middle East\n18 U.S. Doctrinal Constraints On Middle East Peace  \n19 Big Business And The General Population-A Nation Divided  \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:336f7b489e4b2efc1c554d05a783aaf9a00e47d4","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+Everlasting+War+-+America%2C+Imperialism+and+the+Ne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"336f7b489e4b2efc1c554d05a783aaf9a00e47d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,111,123,72,158,75,46,252,28,85,77,5,167,131,170,249,160,14,71,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
