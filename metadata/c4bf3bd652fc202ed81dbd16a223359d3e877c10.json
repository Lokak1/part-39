In an extensive commentary, the author explains the course of the argument from verse to verse and alludes to other theories of classical Indian philosophy and other technical matters. Notes to the translation and commentary go further into the historical and philosophical background of Kumarila's ideas. The book provides an introduction to the history and the development of Indian epistemology, a synopsis of Kumarila's work and an analysis of its argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaperback: 284 pages\r\nPublisher: Routledge; Reprint edition (13 July 2012)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0415648319\r\nISBN-13: 978-0415648318","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4bf3bd652fc202ed81dbd16a223359d3e877c10","amp;dn":"A+Hindu+Critique+of+Buddhist+Epistemology%3A+Kumarila+on+Perceptio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4bf3bd652fc202ed81dbd16a223359d3e877c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,191,59,214,82,252,32,46,216,29,189,22,162,35,53,157,62,135,124,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
