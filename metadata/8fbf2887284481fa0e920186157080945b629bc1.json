Formed in 1986 by Troy Payne (lead vocals) and Richard Witherspoon (lead guitars), their initial line-up was completed by the addition of James Tramel (bass), Daniel C (drums) and Robert Brothers (keyboards).\n\nTheir first release was a self-titled cassette EP, released via the local Blaylox Records label in 1990. The Wake had a significant impact on the gothic/alternative club circuit in the United States, and the group were soon opening for bands like And Also The Trees, Skinny Puppy, Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, Shadow Project and Nine Inch Nails.\n\nTwo subsequent 7&quot; singles (Harlot and Sideshow) increased their fanbase, and in 1993 they released their first full-length album, Masked, on Cleopatra Records. Appearances on a number of compilation albums exposed them further to audiences in France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nA second album, Nine Ways, emerged in 1996. By this time Steven Creighton had replaced James Tramel on bass, although the album sleeve notes thank Tramel &quot;for his extended tour of duty&quot;. Nine Ways was preceded by the Christine CD EP, which featured six tracks remixed by Rosetta Stone. (An additional Masked-era track was also included.) A video for Christine also exists, and is set amongst the Spanish and Aztec landmarks of Mexico City.\n\nA third release, although not entirely new material, BLACKlist, a best of compilation containing both released and unreleased songs, live concert footage, and two studio produced videos, was released in 2008.\n\nPresently the band are on a hiatus; new material is promised in the near future.\n\nDiscography:\n\nAlbums and Singles\nThe Wake Cass (Blaylox 1990)\nHarlot 7&quot; (Blaylox 1991)\nSideshow 7&quot; (Blaylox 1992)\nMasked CD (Cleopatra 1993)\nChristine EP (Cleopatra 1995)\nNine Ways CD (Cleopatra 1996)\nBLACKlist CD/DVD (Cleopatra 2008)\nEmily Closer MP3 (Blaylox 2010)\nCompilation Appearances\nNew Alternatives 2 CD\nNight of the Banshee CD (Sub Terranean)\nL'Appel De La Muse Vol. 3 CD (Alea Jacta Est 1993)\nIn Goth Daze CD (Cleopatra 1994)\nMysterious Encounters CD (Cleopatra 1994)\nThe Fallen Angel CD (Zoth Ommog 1994)\nGothik CD (Cleopatra 1995)\nStars, Hide Your Fires CD (Hyperium Records 1995)\nWired Injections CD (Cleopatra 1996)\nGerman Mystic Sound Sampler Vol. VII CD (Zillo 1998)\n\nThe Wake - Nine Ways\nLabel: Cleopatra Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CLP 9708-2\nFormat: CD, Album \nCountry: US\nReleased: 1996\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Goth Rock\n\nCredits:\n\nEngineer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fluffy\nEngineer [Assistant] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Claudine &quot;Candi&quot; Pontier, Ed, Esther Nevarez, Jamie Duffy, Matt Gibson\nMastered By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jason Rau\nProducer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keith Fluffy Auerbach*, Wake, The\nWritten-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wake, The (tracks: 1 to 9)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fbf2887284481fa0e920186157080945b629bc1","amp;dn":"The+Wake+-+Nine+Ways+%281996%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fbf2887284481fa0e920186157080945b629bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,191,40,135,40,68,129,250,14,146,1,134,21,112,128,148,91,98,155,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
