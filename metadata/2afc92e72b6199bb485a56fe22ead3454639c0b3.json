Chomsky digs into Clinton's bungled health care plan, his business interests, his labor policies, and his involvement with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Despite being the world's foremost linguist, Chomsky is not exactly a charismatic speaker- he drones a bit and offers humor sparingly. His strong, simple words, though, and his big ideas are undeniably engrossing. He takes politics out of the ether and shows us how it affects our lives and the lives of those around us.\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the ''most cited living author''. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 56:12\n\n\n1  Intro\t\n2  Grand Visions from the Whitehouse\t\n3  Clinton and the Future of the Free Market\t\n4  Public Subsidies, Private Profits\n5  China: Human Rights and Nuclear Technology\n6  Class War in the Media: Clinton, the Press, Organized Labor\n7  Why the Elites Hate Democracy\n8  Clinton's Bottom Line: Business Interests\n9  Clinton And Nafta: The Rich Get Richer\n10 Mexico and Free Trade\n11 Nafta: People Suffer As Profits Rise\n12 Nafta, Democracy And The New Economic World Order\n13 US Companies Crush Canadian Insurance Reform\n14 The Corporate Attack on Democracy\n15 Clinton's Health Plan Soaks the Poor\n16 Clinton's Vision and Public Opinion\n17 Social Disintegration and Clinton's Anti-crime Package\n18 A New Policy for the US: What's in it for us?\n19 Beating Down the Working Class\n20 Labor Loses in Clinton Vision\n21 Who were the Real Winners of the Cold War?\n22 What We Can Do\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cSFwR4moL._SL500_AA300_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cSFwR4moL._SL500_AA300_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2afc92e72b6199bb485a56fe22ead3454639c0b3","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+The+Clinton+Vision+Old+Wine%2C+New+Bottles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2afc92e72b6199bb485a56fe22ead3454639c0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,252,146,231,43,97,153,187,72,90,86,254,34,234,211,69,70,57,192,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
