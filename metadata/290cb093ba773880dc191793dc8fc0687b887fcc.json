It can now be officially listed as stable and improving. In fact, the ACA website is doing well enough to receive visitorsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ it had over a million yesterday, with no setbacks. Now the White House is planning a big PR push for the ACA. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an angle they may want to takeÃ¢â‚¬â€millions of people who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have health insurance now have it! The previous healthcare system was a disaster, so having to sell Obamacare to people is like orchestrating a public relations push to convince a drowning man to accept a lifesaver. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know, do you have any colors besides white?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe opponents of Obamacare canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dismiss something that is helping millions of people by just calling it Ã¢â‚¬Å“socialism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And that is as true of Obamacare as it is true of the words of Pope Francis. A Tea Party activist says that Pope FrancisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comments about capitalism are making Jesus weep in heaven. Jonathon Moseley wrote Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jesus was a capitalist, preaching personal responsibility, not a socialist.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I forgot the part in the story of the loaves and fishes, where Jesus made all the people work for the food. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you people clean up around here, you can each have a loaf and fish. But my policy is strictly that no loaf goes to any loafer!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe group Catholics in Alliance is demanding an apology from Rush Limbaugh for his comments about Pope Francis. Good luck with that. The Catholic Church apologizes more often than Rush Limbaugh. And Rush Limbaugh has done more outrageous things than the Catholic Church... despite the ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2,000 year head start. The difference is that the Catholic Church started from a good place and then went wrong at various times over the next two millennia. Rush Limbaugh intentionally started from a bad place and never left.\n\nFinally, Thanksgiving is over, and that means the launch of the annual War on Christmas over at Fox News. Someone should tell them that, if they really want to cover a war, we still have an actual war going on in Afghanistan. As always, the opening shots were fired by Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly. Bill has exploited this phony War on Christmas for almost as much profit as retailers have exploited Christmas itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290cb093ba773880dc191793dc8fc0687b887fcc","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+December+03+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290cb093ba773880dc191793dc8fc0687b887fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,12,176,147,186,119,56,128,220,25,23,147,220,143,192,104,123,136,127,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
