And that's about all anyone can say with certainty about a conflict that has cost 7,000 American lives and almost $2 trillion. As long as the most basic strategic questionsâ€”Who is the enemy? Why are we fighting?â€”remain unanswered, victory is impossible.\r\n \nhttps://www.amazon.ca/Defeating-Jihad-Winnable-Sebastian-Gorka-ebook/dp/B01C911682/ref=sr_1_1/000-0498258-9160077?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468811013&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sebastian+gorka\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2016/07/16\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat I have been trying to convince this city of for many years now is that we have not even begun to engage in the information operations battlefield. We do almost everything at the tactical level and have allowed political correctness to infect the way we do Information Operations and Psychological Warfare. America is preeminent at the application of kinetic force. The U.S. Abbottabad raid will be taught from the Beijing Military Academy to Sandhurst for the next hundred years as how you do a kinetic application of lead-on target. But tactical perfection does not automatically add up to victory. Tactical victories do not necessarily bring strategic success. We must delegitimize the ideology of the enemy or this will be exercise in â€œwhack-a-mole.â€ Your children, my grandchildren, will be hunting jihadists a hundred years from now unless we take down their ideology of Global Jihadism.â€ â€”Testimony to House Armed Services Committeeâ€™s Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, 8 Jan 2016\r\n \nhttps://www.amazon.ca/Defeating-Jihad-Winnable-Sebastian-Gorka-ebook/dp/B01C911682/ref=sr_1_1/000-0498258-9160077?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468811013&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sebastian+gorka\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Gorka","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a2ce2d2285291283b94953ad68e39b40f5a2d6","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+July+16+Sebastian+Gorka+Radical+Islam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a2ce2d2285291283b94953ad68e39b40f5a2d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,162,206,45,34,133,41,18,131,185,73,83,173,104,227,155,64,245,162,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
