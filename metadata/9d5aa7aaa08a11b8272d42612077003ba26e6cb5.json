Well, I just thought that since that song was from their Christmas album last 2 years ago, I do not need to upload them. But hey, people are asking, saying, I do not upload complete episode's song. Don't worry folks, it's been uploaded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5aa7aaa08a11b8272d42612077003ba26e6cb5","amp;dn":"Glee+Cast+-+O+Holy+Night+%5BSingle-320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5aa7aaa08a11b8272d42612077003ba26e6cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,90,167,170,160,138,17,184,39,45,66,97,32,119,0,59,162,110,108,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
