With vintage mic and dresses, and a gardenia tucked into her platinum locks, it's hard to separate her live appeal from the supper-club set dressing aspect. Live, she turns a barroom into a speakeasy with a wink and a whisper. On the record, her light, girlish voice and Delta Royale band turn out standards with aplomb. It's tough to make a mark on swinging standards like 'Bei Meir Bist Du Schoen,&quot; and on emotionally drenched tracks like 'Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans&quot; and Billie Holiday's aching 'Good Morning Heartache,&quot; but Zaorski, along with other familiar downtown faces like Rob Wagner on sax and the fresh touch of Washboard Chaz on a few tracks &quot; did Glenn Miller have a washboard? &quot; does admirably. Sweet and a little spicy, Zaorski adds a kick to a familiar recipe, but for the full effect, catch her after dark with a drink in your hand. (cdbaby)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Between the Devil and the Deep blue Sea\n02 - The Object of My Affection\n03 - I Hate Myself (For Being Mean to You)\n04 - This Can't Be Love\n05 - Good Morning Heartache\n06 - How Deep is the Ocean\n07 - Rhythm In Me\n08 - It's Too Hot For Words\n09 - Just One of Those Things\n10 - You Turned The Tables On Me\n11 - Deed I Do\n12 - The Lady In Red\n13 - Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen\n14 - Do You KNow What It Means To Miss New Orleans\n\nEnjoy and share!
