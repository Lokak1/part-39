This is the longest show here at 90 minutes and Greg Travis is the funniest new guy here. There is also an odd send-up of The Tonight Show with McCann as Ed McMahon and Little as Johnny Carson, and several segments of an equally odd spoof of Sherlock Holmes. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453392/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453392/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2183a26310372159a55f7fde9cb47e9426cae29","amp;dn":"Rodney+Dangerfield+%5B1989%5D+Opening+Night+at+Rodneys+Place+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2183a26310372159a55f7fde9cb47e9426cae29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,24,58,38,49,3,114,21,154,85,247,253,233,203,71,233,66,108,174,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
