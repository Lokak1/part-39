He then joined His Holiness the \nDalai Lama and the Tibetan exile community in India. He was \nappointed by His Holiness as Abbot both of Gyumed Tantric \nMonastery and of Drepung Loseling, two of the greatest seats \nof Tibetan spiritual knowledge. At present Rinpoche carries \nthe title Jangtse Choje, or Dharma Master of the Northern \nPeak, one of the three highest spiritual positions in the \nGelug Tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nRinpoche has made the practice of meditation his principal \nfocus in life, and has conducted numerous extensive retreats, \nincluding a three-year tantric retreat on the Yamantaka \nmandala in a remote hermitage in Ladakh. Through his \nachievements in practice and scholarship, he represents the \npinnacle of the Sutra and Tantra traditions.\n\nRinpoche is renowned for his Tantric powers, and is frequently \ncalled upon by H.H. the Dalai Lama to lead ceremonies for \nhealing and other similar purposes.\n\nFiles in this torrent:\n\nlistoffiles.txt\nThe Eight Verses Of Thought Transformation_01.mp3\nThe Eight Verses Of Thought Transformation_02.mp3\n\n               3 File(s)     10,487,808 bytes\n               \nAccumulate Merit - Keep Sharing!\n\nFor more Buddhist Dharma Torrents see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&lt;/a&gt;\n\n @@  @@                                            \n @@ @@                                             \n @@@@     @@@   @@@  @@@@@@@   @@@   @@@@    @@@   \n @@@        @@  @@ @ @@ @@ @@    @@  @@ @@     @@  \n @@@@     @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@ @@   @@@@  \n @@ @@   @@ @@  @@   @@ @@ @@ @@ @@  @@ @@  @@ @@  \n @@  @@   @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@@@    @@@@  \n                                     @@\n\t\t\t             @@          \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a1a5bfc024d3f53d738e0cfe636ce4bf5558a9","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Dharma+-+Rizong+Rinpoche+-Eight+Verses+of+Enlightenment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a1a5bfc024d3f53d738e0cfe636ce4bf5558a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,161,165,191,192,36,211,245,61,115,142,12,254,99,108,228,191,85,88,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
