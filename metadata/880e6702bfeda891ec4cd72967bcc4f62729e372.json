Players assume the role of the hero Kenji as they develop a village of peasants into a clan of highly specialized warriors. They must defend their village against barbarians, evil magicians and deadly ninja. The game puts the focus of gameplay on the battlefield and features detailed 3D environments, realistic weather effects and a unique battle gear system to advance the abilities of your warriors.\n\nIn singleplayer, the plot mainly revolves around Kenji, last heir to the Serpent's Throne. When he returns from exile, Kenji comes across bandits raiding a peasant village. He can choose to either kill the bandits and save the peasants, or, he can side with the bandits and kill the peasants. If he chooses to save the peasants, he will follow the path of the Dragon clan. If he aids the bandits, he will follow the path of the Serpent clan.\n\nIn Kenji's Journey, the player may choose which territories he or she wishes to attack first. Taking specific territories might give benefits, and other Zen Masters may join Kenji. Later on, the player can summon these Zen Masters from the Keep.\n\nIn the Battle Realms expansion Winter of the Wolf, the player follows the story of Grayback, a wolf miner who started a rebellion to free his fellow wolf clansmen from the clutches of the Lotus and Serpent. In the process, Grayback must defeat the sorceress Yvaine to stop the snow blizzard from killing his clansmen.\n\nNotes:\nÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Battle Realms 1 + Winter of the Wolf (expansion)\nÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Nothing removed, gamedata recoded to very low quality.\nÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Credits: nocd by FBSA, fixedexe &amp; sup by rzr1911\nÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Version: 1.50q ~ Battle Pack 3 (latest version).\nÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Default Res.: 800x600 (u can change in options)\n\nInstallation:\n1) Execute the file OR unrar &amp; run setup.bat\n2) wait (25+30~90 mins) til this msg: &quot;OK All Done - Extraccion finalizada&quot;\n3) Hit Battle_Realms_F.EXE\n4) Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:880e6702bfeda891ec4cd72967bcc4f62729e372","amp;dn":"Battle+Realms+Winter+of+the+Wolf+standalone+repack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"880e6702bfeda891ec4cd72967bcc4f62729e372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,14,103,2,191,237,168,145,236,76,215,41,103,188,196,246,39,41,227,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
