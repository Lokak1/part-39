Glanzman (born December 5, 1924)[1][2] is an American comic-book artist, best known for his Charlton Comics series Hercules, about the mythological Greek demigod; his biographical war stories about his service aboard the U.S.S. Stevens for DC Comics and Marvel Comics; and the Charlton Comics Fightin' Army feature &quot;The Lonely War of Willy Schultz&quot;, a Vietnam-era serial about a German-American U.S. Army captain during World War II.\n\nKona, Monarch of Monster Isle is a fictional American comic book character who was featured in his own self titled series, published by Dell Comics in the 1960s.\nThe character was created during a period of transition for Dell Comics. Up until 1962 Dell had been the official comic book publisher for Western Publishing, the licencer for Walt Disney, Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. among others. This relationship ended when Western made the decision to start its own comic book publishing company, Gold Key Comics.\nFaced with the prospect of losing the rights to all of the series they were publishing, Dell began a large scale campaign in which numerous series and characters were created. This was designed to allow Dell to survive as a company past the point of Gold Key's creation. Of the characters created during this period, Kona was one of Dell's most successful creations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e411e8f9644ea84f1def76c79e70e0fd9c6a5ce","amp;dn":"Sam+Glanzman%3A+Kona%2C+Monarch+of+Monster+Isle+%23+1-21+%28Dell+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e411e8f9644ea84f1def76c79e70e0fd9c6a5ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,65,30,143,150,68,234,132,241,222,247,108,121,231,14,15,217,198,165,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
