But there is no cause for anyone to feel smug. The brain, no matter how well schooled, is just plain bad at dealing with randomness and probability. Confronted with situations that require an intuitive grasp of the odds, even the best mathematicians and scientists can find themselves floundering.\n\n\nSuppose you want to calculate the likelihood of tossing two coins and coming up with one head. The great 18th-century mathematician Jean Le Rond dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Alembert thought the answer was obvious: there are three possibilities, zero, one or two heads. So the odds for any one of those happening must be one in three.\n\n\nBut as Leonard Mlodinow explains in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe DrunkardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ there are, in fact, four possible outcomes: heads-heads, heads-tails, tails-heads and tails-tails. So there is a 25 percent chance of throwing zero or two heads and a 50 percent chance of throwing just one. In the long run, anyone offering dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢AlembertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s odds in a coin-flipping contest would lose his shirt.\n\n\nThe key to puzzles like this, Mlodinow writes, is CardanoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s method, named for Gerolamo Cardano, author of the 16th-century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBook on Games of Chance.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ To lay the odds for even the simplest-seeming event, one constructs a table, or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsample space,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of all the ways FortunaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dice might fall. Trust your instincts instead and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re bound to go wrong.&quot;\n\n\n--from the New York Times review of THE DRUNKARDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S WALK: How Randomness Rules Our Lives By Leonard Mlodinow.\n\n\nRead the rest of the review here: http://nyti.ms/8Z9wb6\n\n\nI decided to post this excellent audio-book as a companion piece to Barbara Ehrenriech's Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America. Both books are a stand-outs in an ocean of half-witted 'self-improvement' horse-shit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce56e861592d739384ce7fd2d80e82f402f1683","amp;dn":"The+Drunkards+Walk-How+Randomness+Rules+Our+Lives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce56e861592d739384ce7fd2d80e82f402f1683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,229,110,134,21,146,215,57,56,76,231,253,45,128,232,47,64,47,22,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
