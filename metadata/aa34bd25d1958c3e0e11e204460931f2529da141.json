Rights\nCompatibility: WinAll, 32/64\n\nNotes: My earlier releases were done in a hurry, almost roughshod. This release\nis the result of hours of personal usage &amp; testing. I also removed \n'3D Invigorator' from Photoshop because it's poorly designed and crashes alot.\nPlus it's quite simple to create 3D Text effect (ALT + Arrow key). In addition,\na few other features are now working like Image Processor, Kuler, etc.\n\nSynopsis: I am extremely anal when it comes to apps. leaving trash on my PC.\nThe only apps. on my PC that are installed is ESET and VMware. Everything else\nis on D drive and portable. Why? notice how fast your computer is when you first\nget it? that's because there aren't tons of installed software to bog down the\nOS. This is why i refuse installation. \n\nThis suite is NOT for career graphics designers. This is portable, thus NOT all\nfeatures will be available... most notably features that require background\nservices to be installed like 'switchboard'. \n\n----------------------------\nADOBE CS5 SOPA SUITE CONTENT\n----------------------------\n1.

First launch is always the longest because it has to initiate files.\nAfterwards, it's faster. Also, when exiting, be patient and let it clean up \nafter itself...  15 seconds is usually sufficient.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Another benefit is you can add plugins, presets, etc.. just copy into the\nrespective folders.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ This is not really recommended for USB usage.. if you're a USB user.. you want\na ThinApp'd version. This is most beneficial for home users who use portable\napps. on their home PCs.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If you're not familiar with the benefits of PortableApps.com Format.. \nthan you do not need this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa34bd25d1958c3e0e11e204460931f2529da141","amp;dn":"Adobe+CS5+SOPA+Suite%26acirc%3B%E2%80%9E%26cent%3B+%28PortableApps.com+Format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa34bd25d1958c3e0e11e204460931f2529da141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,52,189,37,209,149,140,62,14,17,226,4,70,9,49,242,82,157,161,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
