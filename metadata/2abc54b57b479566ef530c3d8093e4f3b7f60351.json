The album was the first to be released by Knight under her new contract with Parlophone Records, with whom she had signed a four album deal with in 1997 after leaving her previous label, Dome Records. The critical acclaim of the album proved to be widespread, with Q magazine calling the album &quot;a triumph not only of KnightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical vision but also of the strength in her character&quot; and The Times remarking &quot;Prodigal Sista is a joy to hear ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ her vocal and intricate self devised and performed harmonies can make you catch your breath in wonderment&quot;[cite this quote]. The success of the album was solidified at the 1999 MOBO Awards in London where Knight was named Best R&amp;B Act and Prodigal Sista beat off competition from FanMail (TLC) and The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (Lauryn Hill) to be named Best Album. The success of the album proved to be much greater than her debut, The B-Funk, which peaked at #145 in Britain. Prodigal Sista peaked at #42 and was awarded a Gold Disk by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 in Britain[\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Wake Up Call\n[02] Made It Back\n[03] Rewind (Find A Way)\n[04] Damn\n[05] A.
