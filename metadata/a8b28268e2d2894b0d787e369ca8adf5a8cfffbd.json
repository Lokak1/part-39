It represents TalebÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view of modern civilizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hubristic side effectsÃ¢â‚¬â€modifying humans to satisfy technology, blaming reality for not fitting economic models, inventing diseases to sell drugs, defining intelligence as what can be tested in a classroom, and convincing people that employment is not slavery.\n\nPlayful and irreverent, these aphorisms will surprise you by exposing self-delusions you have been living with but never recognized.\n\nWith a rare combination of pointed wit and potent wisdom, Taleb plows through human illusions, contrasting the classical values of courage, elegance, and erudition against the modern diseases of nerdiness, philistinism, and phoniness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b28268e2d2894b0d787e369ca8adf5a8cfffbd","amp;dn":"Nicholas+Taleb+-+Bed+of+procusts.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b28268e2d2894b0d787e369ca8adf5a8cfffbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,178,130,104,226,210,137,75,13,120,126,54,156,168,173,245,168,207,255,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
