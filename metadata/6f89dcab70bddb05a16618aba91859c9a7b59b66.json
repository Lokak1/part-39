This compilation is bound to bring out the kid in every reader!&quot; - Marvel Dot Com\n\n&quot;In the out-of-continuity humor series Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius, Franklin is portrayed as a Calvin-esque troublemaker who can't resist &quot;playing&quot; with his father's inventions, with disastrous results. Franklin must then scramble to reverse the effects/clean up after the results of his &quot;play&quot;, with the help of his long-suffering robot nanny H.E.R.B.I.E. (who essentially plays a Hobbes-esque role), or face punishment from his parents. In the Son of a Genius one-shot Everybody Loves Franklin, Franklin encountered a non-superpowered version of Katie Power (the &quot;real&quot; Franklin's former Power Pack teammate); while Franklin at first disliked Katie in stereotypical young boy fashion, he seemed to develop a crush on her (reciprocated by Katie) when he discovered that she had a talent for mayhem similar to his own.&quot; - Wikipedia\n\nThe torrent includes these issues:\n\nFranklin Richards - Son Of A Genius.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Everybody Loves Franklin.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Super Summer Spectacular.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Happy Thanksgiving.cbr\nFranklin Richards - March Madness.cbr\nFranklin Richards - (Marvel Adventures) (FCBD).cbr - short story\nFranklin Richards - World Be Warned.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Monster Mash.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Fall Football Fiasco.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Spring Break.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Not-So-Secret Invasion.cbr\nFranklin Richards - Summer Smackdown.cbr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f89dcab70bddb05a16618aba91859c9a7b59b66","amp;dn":"Franklin+Richards+Collection+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f89dcab70bddb05a16618aba91859c9a7b59b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,137,220,171,112,189,219,5,161,102,24,171,169,24,89,201,167,181,155,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
