With Gunnar BjÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶rnstrand as host, we visit Hell and accompany a couple of lost souls on their return to the living to corrupt some fairly innocent souls. More of a comedy than your average Bergman fare.\n\nNot as rare as the other Chinese box posts I've upped, but still a &quot;rarity&quot;.\nMostly proper subs, though a couple of interesting mix-ups, Pasteur for Pastor and, on occasion, host for guest (at least etymologically related). No signs of Chinglish.\n\n\n\nNTSC VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0477fce0b3a33a736b57cfc76f42492d3c86cbc6","amp;dn":"Ingmar+Bergman+-+Djavulens+oga+%2F+The+Devil%5C%27s+Eye+-+1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0477fce0b3a33a736b57cfc76f42492d3c86cbc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,119,252,224,179,163,58,115,107,87,207,199,111,66,73,45,60,134,203,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
