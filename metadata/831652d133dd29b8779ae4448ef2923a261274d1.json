It focuses on how to develop professional Windows Forms applications with C#. But along the way, it teaches you the C# language and core skills that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use to develop any C# applicationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦whether for Windows or for the web.\n\nThe content continues to evolve with the language, of course. For example, this edition ends with an introduction to Windows 8 programming, so you can see whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involved in creating touch-screen applications that run on tablets.\n\nBut one thing has stayed the same over the years: We still call this Ã¢â‚¬Å“the C# book youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll wish youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d bought firstÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because it gets you developing professional C# applications without any wasted time or effort.\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for anyone who wants to learn how to use C# 2012 to develop Windows Forms applications.\n\n- It works if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s .NET development environment.\n- It works if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re an experienced .NET developer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new to C#.\n- It works if you have programming experience with another language like Java, C++, or COBOL.\n- And it works if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already read 3 or 4 other C# 2012 books and still donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to develop a real-world business application.\n\nTable of Contents\nSection 1: An introduction to Visual Studio\nChapter 1.
