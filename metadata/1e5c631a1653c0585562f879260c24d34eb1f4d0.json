Normally I leave videos in HD, but this show when broadcast on 4HD was actually upscaled to 1080i from a standard definition recording so there is no benefit to having a HD rip this time.\n\nEncoded with Handbrake (High Profile @ 1500kb/s), with MKV Merge to remux.\n\nAbout as close as you'll get to broadcast quality without the original TS file!\n\nI uploaded this one because there doesn't appear to be a torrent copy anywhere else.  It's a stand-up comedy performance by Al Murray (The Pub Landlord), where he takes a humourous look back at 1997 with banter, video clips, interviews with people who were famous at the time and a live music performance at the end.  If you're an Al Murray fan you should add this to your collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5c631a1653c0585562f879260c24d34eb1f4d0","amp;dn":"Al.Murray.My.Funniest.Year.HDTV.480p.x264-ZeKe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5c631a1653c0585562f879260c24d34eb1f4d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,92,99,26,22,83,192,88,85,98,248,121,38,12,36,211,78,177,244,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
