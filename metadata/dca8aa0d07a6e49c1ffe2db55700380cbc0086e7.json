Making Memories\n\n\n\nOften when an artist releases a new album, it takes a few listens to get into it, to appreciate the new songs and how they relate to the older material. Every now and then, though, a new album sounds like an old friend. James MaddockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Another Life is one of them. From the first cut to the last, this is music you want to climb into and live in for a while.\n\nJamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ husky but sweet voice sings songs about the choices we make in life, about nostalgia, and about events that leave an indelible mark on us. A recurring theme is how what we have chosen to do in the past leads us to where we are now, and what might have happened if we had gone down another road.\n\nThe arrangements are impeccable: light but not too light, with plenty of room for the lyrics to shine through. Particular standouts are the title track, the achingly beautiful Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leicestershire Mist,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the bittersweet Ã¢â‚¬Å“Better on My Own.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOne track that I think doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite work is Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Heavy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the sad story of a captured WWII pilot who finds out that the town who tried to help him escape was wiped out in a Nazi reprisal. He ends up taking his own life. A sad story but told in a jaunty way thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incongruous.\n\nAs we found out during JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wonderful show at the Hamilton Stage, he is also an engaging performer who seems to love his work. This feeling permeates Another Life. It should be on any list of 2013's best new music...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca8aa0d07a6e49c1ffe2db55700380cbc0086e7","amp;dn":"James+Maddock+-+Another+Life+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca8aa0d07a6e49c1ffe2db55700380cbc0086e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,168,170,13,7,166,228,156,31,254,45,181,87,0,56,12,188,0,134,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
