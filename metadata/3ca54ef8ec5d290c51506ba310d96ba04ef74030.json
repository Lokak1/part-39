While technology amazes humankindÃ¢â‚¬Â¦human life expectancy is very short and the ones alive suddenly develop health problems at a very young ageÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ In this scenario, we follow the relationship between Eward and Claris. He, a young man living in Barcelona. She, a prodigy scientist working in Tokyo. Eward hates technology, always having problems when dealing with it. Claris on the other hand loves technology, a scientist with a very particular objective working on a secret project to extend human life expectancy. In this world ruled by megacorporations, Claris and Eward will have to break rules, turn down protocols... making us wonder: What is the limit to love?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca54ef8ec5d290c51506ba310d96ba04ef74030","amp;dn":"Transmeet+%282012%29+%28Digital%29+%28K6-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca54ef8ec5d290c51506ba310d96ba04ef74030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,165,78,248,236,93,41,12,81,80,107,163,16,217,107,160,78,247,64,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
