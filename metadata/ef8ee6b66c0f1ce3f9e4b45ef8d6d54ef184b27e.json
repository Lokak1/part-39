Liz Story, Danny Wright and Jim Brickman are among an international line up of musicians. It includes new compositions by Story, Wright, and Oystein Sevag. The songs run from the low-key, moody pieces such as &quot;The Sad Balconies of Heaven&quot; by Mark Darnell and &quot;Deep Water Gospel&quot; by W.A. Mathieu to the sprightly &quot;Playground&quot; by Henry Curtis and &quot;Don't Stop Now&quot; by Philip Aaberg. This is a followup to one of Windham Hill's most popular collections of music, The Windham Hill Piano Sampler 1 previously released in 1985.\n\n Tracklist\n\n1 \tHenry Adam Curtis \t\tPlayground \t\t3:56\n2 \tBob Leon \t\t\tAlong The Salmon \t\t3:41\n3 \tFernando Ortega \t\tAs For Us \t\t\t3:51\n4 \tMark Darnell \t\tThe Sad Balconies Of Heaven \t4:04\n5 \tLiz Story \t\t\tEasy Access \t\t3:33\n6 \tÃƒËœystein SevÃƒÂ¥g \t\tChildren's Song \t\t3:51\n7 \tW.
