I always have. To me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very simple: if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnd hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how he does it: the art of the deal.\n\nBeginning with a week in TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-stakes life, Trump: The Art of the Deal gives us Trump in action. We see just how he operates day to dayÃ¢â‚¬â€how he runs his business and how he runs his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€as he chats with friends and family, clashes with enemies, efficiently buys up Atlantic CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top casinos, changes the face of the New York City skyline . . . and plans the tallest building in the world.\n\nEven a maverick plays by rules, and here Trump formulates his own eleven guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest deals; he shatters myths (Ã¢â‚¬Å“You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily need the best location. What you need is the best dealÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½); he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-makerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art: from the abandoned property that became the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to the seedy hotel that became the Grand Hyatt; from the race to rebuild Central ParkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wollman Skating Rink to the byzantine saga of the property that became Trump Tower. And throughout, Trump talksÃ¢â‚¬â€really talksÃ¢â‚¬â€about how he does it.\n\nDonald Trump is blunt, brash, surprisingly old-fashioned in spotsÃ¢â‚¬â€and always, always an original. Trump: The Art of the Deal is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur and an unprecedented education in the art of the deal. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the most streetwise business book there isÃ¢â‚¬â€and a sizzling read for anyone interested in money and success.\n\n\n\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American business magnate, investor, television personality, and author. Currently running for the office of President of the United States, he is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts.\n\nDonald Trump is the very definition of the American success story, continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate, sports and entertainment. He is a graduate of the Wharton School of Finance. An accomplished author, Mr. Trump has authored over fifteen bestsellers, and his first book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic and one of the most successful business books of all time.\n\nMr. Trump has over 7 million followers on social media. He frequently uses this platform to advocate for Conservative causes, Republican candidates and to educate the public on the failures of the Obama administration. Mr. Trump appears on Fox and Friends on Monday mornings and devotes much of his time to media interviews in order to promote a Free Market, the importance of a strong family, a culture of Life, a strong military and our countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sacred obligation to take care of our veterans and their families.\n\nMr. Trump was born in Queens, New York. He is married to Melania Trump and father to Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and Barron. He is a proud grandfather of seven","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e959952ec96451ab563367835bf9100a12e57cd1","amp;dn":"Trump%3A+The+Art+of+the+Deal+-+Donald+J.+Trump","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e959952ec96451ab563367835bf9100a12e57cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,89,149,46,201,100,81,171,86,51,103,131,91,249,16,10,18,229,124,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
