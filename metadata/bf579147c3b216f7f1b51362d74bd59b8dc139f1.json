And nature was obliging indeed, judging from the lovely designs in Sasha Kagan's Country Inspiration. A leading knitwear designer with an international reputation, Kagan uses leaves and flowers as the basis for creating a variety of garments and home decor items. This classic collection includes her trademark sweaters, as well as throws, pillows, and bedcovers. The process is made easier and more fun with simple, full-color graphs for each of the book's 40 projects, and the patterns elegantly showcase the author's unerring sense of color and style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf579147c3b216f7f1b51362d74bd59b8dc139f1","amp;dn":"Sasha+Kagan%27s+Country+Inspiration+-+Knitwear+for+All+Seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf579147c3b216f7f1b51362d74bd59b8dc139f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,87,145,71,195,178,22,247,241,181,19,98,215,75,213,155,141,193,57,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
