And before Kansa could destroy his sister s eight child, born to kill him, he was taken away to Gokhul where he was brought up as the son of Nand and Yashoda.\n\nWhen Kansa came to know that his enemy was growing up in Gokul, he sent one demon after another to kill him. But instead, Putana, Kaliya and all other demons were destroyed by Krishna. Ultimately Kansa sent Akrura to bring Gopal Krishna to Mathura-little knowing that he was inviting his own death!\n\nTo save his life Kansa used every power that he possessed. But, alas, all his powers failed and in the battle of wits as well as guts that ensured between them Kansa, the tyrant met his death at the hands of his nephew Lord Krishna.\n\nStarring: Sachin, Zarina Wahab, Paintal, Jeevan, Manhar Desai, Mahipal, Rita Bhaduri,\nDirector: Vijay Sharma\nProducer: Tarachand Barjatya\nMusic: Ravindra Jain\n\nResolution: 528 x 278\nFormat: XviD\nAudio: MP3, 128 kbps VBR\nSize: 1,45GB\nRuntime: 02:12:23\nLanguage: Hindi\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09120a82415d6e6afcbda54d31851d34fc6a6141","amp;dn":"Gopal+Krishna+%281979%29-+DVDRip+-+XviD+-+AC3+-+ESubs+-+%5Bllallitta%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09120a82415d6e6afcbda54d31851d34fc6a6141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,18,10,130,65,93,110,106,252,189,165,77,49,133,29,52,252,106,97,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
