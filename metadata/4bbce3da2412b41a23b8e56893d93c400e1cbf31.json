The original release featured only 5 of the 15 cuts supplied here--about 40 minutes of music compared with almost 80 minutes on this rerelease. While the highlight on the original release was the debut of &quot;La Plus Belle Africaine,&quot; composed for the World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal, the highlight of this reissue is its fullness--the idea that we can listen to a full program of red-hot Ellington band. The band smokes in the uptempo title cut (with trumpeter Cat Anderson and tenor king Paul Gonsalves turning in eye-bulging solos), while on &quot;Sophisticated Lady,&quot; Duke&amp;#039;s piano accompaniment to Harry Carney&amp;#039;s astonishing horn illustrates both the band&amp;#039;s remarkable chops and Duke&amp;#039;s incomparable skills as a composer and arranger. Throughout the record, Duke keeps it fast and loose, pulling out a swinging &quot;Wings and Things&quot; leading into scorching versions of &quot;The Opener,&quot; before heading into a steamy and sultry &quot;Caravan.&quot; An obligatory run through &quot;Take the &amp;#039;A&amp;#039; Train&quot; closes this revised, and much more substantial, Soul Call. --S.
