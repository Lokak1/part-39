It was written and released in stead of the double album Green, as a way of making up for having to postpone Green indefinitely at the time. The first track, 'Green', harnesses viola and pan pipes, harsh and clean vocals to create a general representation of the folk metal influences on Red Ankh. The second and third tracks are short instrumental pieces centered around Germanic and Siberian bag pipes and Caribbean steel pan drums respectively. The last time Red Ankh focused on steel drum melodies was in the track Steel Air on Blue. K.H.D.'s remix is medieval gabber at its finest.\ncredits\nreleased 17 October 2014 \n\nDrums, Guitars, Viola, Pan Pipes, Bag Pipes, Pan Drums, Vox, Programming, Composition, Mastering, Crappy Shop Art, the whole shebang - Shyft Trakia-Vorga VahtiDahl \n\nRemix credit for track four - Kyat Dittman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fceb2e23690024a3dc4205a47307284cd6fcb84d","amp;dn":"Red+Ankh+-+Little+Green+EP+%282014%29+%5Bfolk+metal%2C+320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fceb2e23690024a3dc4205a47307284cd6fcb84d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,235,46,35,105,0,36,163,220,66,5,164,115,7,40,76,214,252,184,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
