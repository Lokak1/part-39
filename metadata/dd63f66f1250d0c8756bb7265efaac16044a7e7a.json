It is based on advances made in nuclear power utilization and computational methods over the past 40 years, covering core design of boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors, as well as fast reactors and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. The objectives of this book are to help graduate and advanced undergraduate students to understand core design and analysis, and to serve as a background reference for engineers actively working in light water reactors. Methodologies for core design and analysis, together with physical descriptions, are emphasized. The book also covers coupled thermal hydraulic core calculations, plant dynamics, and safety analysis, allowing readers to understand core design in relation to plant control and safety","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd63f66f1250d0c8756bb7265efaac16044a7e7a","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Reactor+Design+-+An+Advanced+Course+in+Nuclear+Engineeri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd63f66f1250d0c8756bb7265efaac16044a7e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,99,246,111,18,80,208,200,117,107,183,38,94,250,172,22,4,74,126,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
