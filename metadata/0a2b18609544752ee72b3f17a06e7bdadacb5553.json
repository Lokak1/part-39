Found all over the Amazon, Ayahuasca and it's incredible ability to heal has been slowly but steadily creeping into western consciousness. Metamorphosis is a documentary that follows several westerners as they undergo five Ayahuasca ceremonies and experience the gamut of emotions - from utter fear to outright ecstasy. It also explores the shamans who work with the medicine as well as all the key elements of an Ayahuasca ceremony.\n\nThe film also tells the story of Hamilton Souther, who earlier in life had no belief of and in spirit. After having a spiritual awakening, Hamilton is led to the Amazon where he apprentices as an Ayahuascero, or person who practices medicine with Ayahuasca. Hamilton and Maestro Don Alberto (an indigenous master shaman for over thirty years that practices with Hamilton) take us through the ceremonies as well as explain the meaning behind them.\n\nAs the film progresses , we follow the journey that the participants take through the plant medicine. The difficulties of the experience are revealed as well as why each of the participants has come. Integral elements of the ceremony, such as the icaros (songs sung in ceremony) and the &quot;purge&quot; are explored further.\n\nFinally, we get to see the transformations people have undergone, from physical to emotional to spiritual, after having spent more than a week with Ayahuasca. They reflect on their experiences and share what they have learned, leaving profoundly transformed from when they first arrived.\n\nIF YOU ENJOY THIS FILM PLEASE SUPPORT THE FILMMAKER KEITH AT http://metamorphosisfilm.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a2b18609544752ee72b3f17a06e7bdadacb5553","amp;dn":"Metamorphosis+-+Ayahuasca+Documentary+By+Keith+Aronowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a2b18609544752ee72b3f17a06e7bdadacb5553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,43,24,96,149,68,117,46,231,43,63,23,160,110,123,218,218,203,85,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
