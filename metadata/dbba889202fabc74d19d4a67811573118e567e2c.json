Release notes ??????????????????????????????????????? ??? ? ?\n\n     Breakbeat was slumbering away peacefully before the\n     Plump DJs gave it a loud wakeup call with their first\n     release &amp;#039;Electric Disco/Plumpy Chunks&amp;#039; in 1999. With\n     thundering momentum, their critically acclaimed\n     productions reformatted dancefloors and perceptions,\n     and set new production standards. Some were scared\n     silly, few fell back asleep, but many jumped up for a\n     shower of Plump freshness. And an alarming universal\n     consensus was formed. Everyone wanted a piece of the\n     Plump pie, and fat was in.\n\n     Inspired by a top shelf girlie mag entitled Plumpers,\n     Lee Rous and Andy Gardner met and the Plump DJs were\n     born. It would be nice to say that before making music,\n     the Plump DJs had glamorous jobs - but we can1t. Before\n     the duo met Andy worked in a cardboard box factory and\n     Lee was a waiter at a Berni Inn. The music started as a\n     hobby and after a number of excursions and\n     collaborations with the Freskanova camp, the two found\n     their oats at the Finger Lickin&amp;#039; stable.\n\n     A global need for the bold attitude, squidgy sounds,\n     and Behemoth basslines amplified by the Plumps pushed\n     the duo into their Soho based Laboratoire Plump to\n     manifest a large destiny. Jerk to inflate! Inflate it\n     did, next vinyl.\n\n     &amp;#039;The Push/Remember My Name&amp;#039; on Finger Lickin&amp;#039;, waxed\n     the hairs off everyone&amp;#039;s legs and the screams of\n     delight led the lads into completing their feature\n     album &quot;A Plump Night Out&quot; in 1999. The album sampler\n     rocketed to No.1 on DJ magazine Breaks and Beats chart\n     for three issues in a row.\n\n     Before Lee and Andy could smile for another photo\n     shoot, remix opportunities were piled on the doorstep.\n     Jumpin&amp;#039; and Pumpin&amp;#039; (with perhaps a bit of pimpin1)\n     through the year of chronic concoctions the Plump DJs&amp;#039;\n     spin of Stakker Humanoid&amp;#039;s classic &amp;#039;Humanoid&amp;#039; and a\n     spate of other remixes for The Freestylers, DeeJay Punk\n     Roc and Mint Royale ballooned their status. Perfecting\n     a repertoire of coercive gruff sounds, the Plumps were\n     in high demand.\n\n     Their remixes for the likes of BT and Orbital became\n     the bubbles of oxygen that rose to the top of the ocean\n     of global dance music. The Plump ship made waves,\n     putting the excitable &quot;Oh&quot; back into H20. Historians,\n     dance music critiques, and Soho restaurateurs chuckled\n     with glee as Lee and Andy won the Galaxy loaded with\n     dancefloor ammunition; launching Smartbombs and\n     dropping laughing gas onto Funny Break terrain,\n     replacing testosterone nu-skool with accessible sonic\n     boom and arse wiggle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbba889202fabc74d19d4a67811573118e567e2c","amp;dn":"VA_Plump_Djs-Urban_Underground_Vol.1-2CD-2001-CBM+-%3DDIRFIX%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbba889202fabc74d19d4a67811573118e567e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,186,136,146,2,250,188,116,209,157,74,103,129,21,115,17,142,86,126,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
