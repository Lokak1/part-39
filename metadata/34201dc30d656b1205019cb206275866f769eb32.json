The idea is to mix metal and Celtic music .\n\nFollowing the release of their EP VÃƒÂªn in October 2003 , Chrigel decided to make Eluveitie a real band and recruited new musicians (some of whom had participated in VÃƒÂªn). They signed in 2004 a contract with Fear Dark Records , which distributes their new album, Spirit . In 2008, Eluveitie signed to Nuclear Blast and sort (on 15 February 2008 ) his second album, Slania .\n\nThe song Inis Mona meets a great success and contributes to the group's popularity grow. It is the song of the group the most viewed on Youtube.\n\nLive at Metalcamp is their first live album: it contains the songs from their first two albums and their EP\n\nMid- July 2008 , the twins Rafi and Sevan leave the band for personal reasons, they are now replaced by Pade Kistler and Kay Brem.\n\nOn 17 April 2009 released the third studio album named Eluveitie Evocation I - The Arcane Dominion , an entirely acoustic album Omnos is their second single..\n\nEluveitie returns to the metal in 2010 with the release on 19 February 's Everything Remains As It Never Was , their fourth studio album. Gallic songs are less present, and the group again based more on English.\n\nThe band's fifth album, Helvetios , an album that attempts to recreate the conquest of Gaul in terms of Helvetian, was released February 10, 2012 .\n\nThe group plans today the release of two new albums, one with accents and other metals with strong accents like Celtic Evocation I - The Arcane Dominion , according to the revelations of Chrigel Glanzmann .
