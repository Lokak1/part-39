Offit, &quot;Do You Believe in Magic?: The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine&quot;\n2013 | ISBN-10: 0062222961 | EPUB\n\nIn Do You Believe in Magic?, medical expert Paul A. Offit, M.D., offers a scathing exposÃƒÂ© of the alternative medicine industry, revealing how even though some popular therapies are remarkably helpful due to the placebo response, many of them are ineffective, expensive, and even deadly.\n\nDr. Offit reveals how alternative medicineÃ¢â‚¬â€an unregulated industry under no legal obligation to prove its claims or admit its risksÃ¢â‚¬â€can actually be harmful to our health.\n\nUsing dramatic real-life stories, Offit separates the sense from the nonsense, showing why any therapyÃ¢â‚¬â€alternative or traditionalÃ¢â‚¬â€should be scrutinized. He also shows how some nontraditional methods can do a great deal of good, in some cases exceeding therapies offered by conventional practitioners.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e39d0cd1d6840565d2e827cc9d0495f0f3d377e6","amp;dn":"The+Sense+and+Nonsense+of+Alternative+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e39d0cd1d6840565d2e827cc9d0495f0f3d377e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,157,12,209,214,132,5,101,210,232,39,204,157,4,149,240,243,211,119,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
