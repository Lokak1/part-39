Culled from recordings in 1976 and 1977, including songs that Elvis recorded at Graceland, it is a fitting finale to Elvis and his musical legacy. The Moody Blue album is a bit stronger effort than 1976\\'s \\&quot;From Elvis Presley Blvd., Memphis, Tennessee\\&quot;, his 2nd to last studio album. Unlike the \\'76 LP, 77\\'s major studio/touring effort features songs that are intertwined with meaning and impact. From the haunting \\&quot;He\\'ll Have To Go\\&quot;, to the personal \\&quot;It\\'s Easy For You\\&quot;, this is a very personal album indeed. \\&quot;Moody Blue\\&quot; is a fitting title track and \\&quot;Way Down\\&quot;, the album\\'s biggest hit mirrors Elvis\\' drug demise only weeks after this record\\'s release. Also, don\\'t miss the cut \\&quot;Pledging My Love\\&quot;, a remake of the old Johnny Ace tune. Strangely, Elvis does covers of Jim Reeves and Johnny Ace on this recording, both of whom died young and tragically... just as Elvis soon would. This is a strong effort, overall, and a very meaningful one too. \n\n-- Taken from Amazon.com; customer review.   \n\n\nTrack Listing....:  \n  01.Unchained melody  [02:37]\n  02.If you love me    [03:03]\n(let me know)  \n  03.Little darlin\\'    [01:56]\n  04.He\\'ll have to go  [04:36]\n  05.Let me be there   [03:39]\n  06.Way down[02:42]\n  07.Pledging my love  [02:51]\n  08.Moody blue   [02:53]\n  09.She thinks I still care[03:51]\n  10.It\\'s easy for you [03:30]\n____ \n\n  31:38 min    \n   42,4 MB    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69814e733f5373d7c64c335ec010a780aeb08527","amp;dn":"Elvis_Presley-Moody_Blue-%28Retail%29-1991-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69814e733f5373d7c64c335ec010a780aeb08527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,129,78,115,63,83,115,215,198,76,51,94,192,16,167,128,174,176,133,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
