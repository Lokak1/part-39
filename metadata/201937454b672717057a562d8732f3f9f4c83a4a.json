It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug &quot;food chain&quot;, from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/c0vyx3g5h/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/c0vyx3g5h/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ctaq0tyoh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ctaq0tyoh/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/rzoxzecal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/rzoxzecal/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy And Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:201937454b672717057a562d8732f3f9f4c83a4a","amp;dn":"The+Wire+Season+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"201937454b672717057a562d8732f3f9f4c83a4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,25,55,69,75,103,39,23,5,122,86,45,135,50,243,249,244,200,58,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
