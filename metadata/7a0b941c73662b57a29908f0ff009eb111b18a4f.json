If you don't feel the importance of supporting these people, you haven't been listening to your shrooms. This can be remedied as follows: ingest a larger amount, lay in silent darkness (to quote the Irish bard), and think about reality for a while. \n\nThen donate to The Entheogen Review, and if you have some time left, try to help save the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a0b941c73662b57a29908f0ff009eb111b18a4f","amp;dn":"The+Entheogen+Review+%281992-2008%29+one+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a0b941c73662b57a29908f0ff009eb111b18a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,11,148,28,115,102,43,87,162,153,8,240,255,0,158,177,17,177,138,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
