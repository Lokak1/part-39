The original team was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Sal Buscema in The Avengers #71 (December 1969). A present-day incarnation was introduced by writer Chuck Austen and artist Scott Kolins in The Avengers vol. 3, #82 (July 2004).\n\nThe Invaders team first appeared in flashback stories set during World War II, and comprised existing characters from Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel. Originally, Captain America (Steve Rogers), his sidekick Bucky (James Barnes), the original android Human Torch (&quot;Jim Hammond&quot;), the Torch's sidekick Toro (Thomas Raymond), and Namor the Sub-Mariner were together as heroes opposing the forces of Nazism. When these superheroes saved the life of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill from Master Man, the thankful Churchill suggested that they should become a team, known as the Invaders.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f31932077ffb7f9246a739d2663ace00951ae78c","amp;dn":"The+Invaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f31932077ffb7f9246a739d2663ace00951ae78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,25,50,7,127,251,127,146,70,167,57,210,102,58,206,0,149,26,231,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
