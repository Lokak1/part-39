Written by an expert from the West Coast, where Americaâ€™s craft beer movement got its start, The Beer Bible is the ultimate reader- and drinker-friendly guide to all the worldâ€™s beers.\r\n\r\nNo other book of this depth and scope approaches the subject of beer?in the same way that beer lovers doâ€”by style, just as a perfect pub menu is organizedâ€”and gets right to the pleasure of discovery, knowledge, and connoisseurship. Divided into four major familiesâ€”ales, lagers, wheat beers, and tart and wild alesâ€”thereâ€™s everything a beer drinker wants to know about the hundreds of different authentic types of brews, from bitters, bocks, and IPAs to weisses, milk stouts, lambics, and more. Each style is a chapter unto itself, delving into origins, ingredients, description and characteristics, substyles, and tasting notes, and ending with a recommended list of the beers to know in each category. Hip infographics throughout make the explanation of beerâ€™s flavors, brewing methods, ingredients, labeling, serving, and more as immediate as it is lively","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3fed2e4325e99b5ae21c94dfd5d275e37fbe534","amp;dn":"The+Beer+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3fed2e4325e99b5ae21c94dfd5d275e37fbe534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,254,210,228,50,94,153,181,174,33,201,77,253,93,39,94,55,251,229,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
