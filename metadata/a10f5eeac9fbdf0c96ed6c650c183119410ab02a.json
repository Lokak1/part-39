Their first LP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Go EastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was issued on Up Records in 1980, the next three albums - on Good Noise Records (1982-1985). Leningrad Sandwich started around 1980 as a punk band of British ex-pats in Germany releasing the 'Go East' LP on Up Records. A quick lineup change added Annie Lloyd on vocals in time for the 'Heat' LP in 1982 on Good Noise Records. The music showed a departure from the band's original punk sound in favor of a darker new wave style that would follow through the subsequent releases, 'Steps' (1983) and 'Priests And Petrol' (1985), both also on Good Noise.\n\nBassplayer of the band was Dimitri Hegemann\n\nKnown for their contribution to the compilation album &quot;Dig This - A Tribute to the great strike (1985).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a10f5eeac9fbdf0c96ed6c650c183119410ab02a","amp;dn":"Leningrad+Sandwich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a10f5eeac9fbdf0c96ed6c650c183119410ab02a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,15,94,234,201,251,223,12,150,237,108,101,12,24,49,25,65,10,176,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
