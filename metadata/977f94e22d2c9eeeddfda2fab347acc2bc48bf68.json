Beginning with an overview of the research on combustion and gas dynamics in the 1970s and 1980s, the author brings you up to date by covering modeling techniques and asymptotic and perturbative methods and ending with a chapter on computational methods.\n\nMost of the book deals with the mathematical analysis of explosions, but computational results are also included wherever they are available. Historical perspectives are provided on the advent of nonlinear science, as well as on the mathematical study of the blast wave phenomenon, both when visualized as a point explosion and when simulated as the expansion of a high-pressure gas.\n\nThis volume clearly reveals the ingenuity of the human mind to conceptualize, model, and mathematically analyze highly complicated nonlinear phenomena such as nuclear explosions. It presents a solid foundation of knowledge that encourages further research and original ideas.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 288 pages\n    * Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 1 edition (May 25, 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1584884223\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1584884224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977f94e22d2c9eeeddfda2fab347acc2bc48bf68","amp;dn":"Shock+Waves+%26amp%3B+Explosions+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977f94e22d2c9eeeddfda2fab347acc2bc48bf68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,127,148,226,45,44,158,238,221,253,162,250,179,71,172,194,188,72,191,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
