What do you say when your faith is challenged by those claiming to speak in the name of science or reason? Discerning Truth provides a practical and engaging resource on the use of logic in this critical debate.\n-Filled with anecdotes from both creative examples and real-life illustrations that help clarify logical issues in apologetics.\n-Become skilled at distinguishing sound arguments from emotionally-charged rhetoric.\n-Helps any believer refute evolutionary perspectives. Lisle believes that creationists need to be able to recognize and refute evolutionist arguments, and to do so in a way that both honors God and lines up with the truth of His Word (Eph. 5:1).\nThe role of logic, the study of correct reasoning, is becoming a vanishing skill in our society. Yet it is a vital tool in assisting Christians in assessing the weaknesses in evolutionary thought. Here is the clear and concise guide for every believer in defending your faith in the face of adversity.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Lisle graduated summa cum laude from Ohio Wesleyan University where he double-majored in physics and astronomy, and minored in mathematics. He did graduate work at the University of Colorado where he earned a MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics. While there, Dr Lisle used the SOHO spacecraft to investigate motions on the surface of the sun as well as solar magnetism and subsurface weather. His thesis was entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Probing the Dynamics of Solar Supergranulation and its Interaction with Magnetism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Among other things, he discovered a previously unknown polar alignment of supergranules (solar convection cells), and discovered evidence of solar giant cells. He has also authored a number of papers in both secular and creation literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e751525cbf4da5a65bcf4038ece0e49a3c163ca","amp;dn":"Discerning+Truth+-+Dr.+Jason+Lisle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e751525cbf4da5a65bcf4038ece0e49a3c163ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,117,21,37,203,244,218,90,101,188,244,3,142,206,14,73,163,193,99,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
