Also, she speaks and sings of plenty of awkward moments that help you laugh if you ever get stuck in one. Some things commonly heard at a Mary Mack show:&quot;I hate comedy, but I liked you.&quot; (We don't know if this is good or bad...probably good. &quot;I haven't belly laughed in a long time.&quot; (Belly laughs are good for the hormones, plus you don't need to do any sit-ups that day. &quot;I'll have some of what she's smoking.&quot; (Mack isn't smoking anything. She's just normally weird. Rumor has it that Mack plans to have some re-editing done to this album and re-release it as an actual vinyl record. Obviously, she's not in it for the money.\n\nRated PG 13, not for dummies.\n\nLabel\tCD Baby\nCatalog number\t123758\nDiscs\t1\nRelease Date\tFeb 20, 2007\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f4bf53e2fae82aa5f2972f189192851c0a0d98a","amp;dn":"Mary+Mack+-+Either+You+Wake+Up+or+You+Don%27t+%5BComedy%5D+2007+%5B128%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f4bf53e2fae82aa5f2972f189192851c0a0d98a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,75,245,62,47,174,130,170,95,41,114,241,137,25,40,81,192,160,217,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
