Hunter would normally laugh in his face, if it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t explain all the spontaneous fires that happen only when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearby. Still, the logic is a little hard for a smart, socially isolated eighteen-year-old to comprehend. That is, until Joshua explains the truth behind her parentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.\n\nSpun into a new life filled with cold truth, terrifying wonder and a mountain of responsibility, Hunter faces the flames dwelling inside her. But the fire is more deadly than Hunter can comprehend. It explodes when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s angry. It erupts when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afraid. And, worst of all, it threatens the life of her boyfriend Eli, who is innocently unaware of her abilities.\n\nSo how does an extraordinary teenager juggle dealing with superpowers between work, graduating and keeping her hormones in check?\n\nSimple. By fighting fire with fire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c387ea2146eef2e92be88d271e75426c05fe97ea","amp;dn":"Rouge+by+Isabella+Modra.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c387ea2146eef2e92be88d271e75426c05fe97ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,135,234,33,70,238,242,233,43,232,141,39,30,117,66,108,5,254,151,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
