WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re crazy about it, and it was gratifying to see that some of the Oshima authorities are too. Drunkards is shot in eye-popping widescreen and pulsing colour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from purple underwear to paisley trousers to hot pink outfits sported at an onsen (hot spring) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and scored with crazed insistence (the music veers from James Bond parody to a pop song by lead Kazuhiko Kato, celebrated singer of the Sadistic Mika Band and the tall one of the three lead actors). All the better to serve its Hard DayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Night tale of a trio of hapless young guys who have their clothes stolen while cavorting in the sea, are mistaken for Korean stowaways, and become involved with a young woman whose brutal older husband, sporting an eye patch and metal hook, represents JapanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repressive older generation. This is 1968, after all, and amid the hi-jinx, chases, conceptual jokes and flash costume changes (including one into female drag), Oshima injects stinging commentary on the Vietnam War, JapanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s war guilt, and prejudice against Koreans, and gives the film a very powerful and moving finale. Reminiscent moment to moment of Tashlin, Godard, Sam Fuller, BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel, Drunkards makes for raucous satire, brilliantly achieved and surprisingly touching.
