The 15-piece Buddy Rich big band features Steve Marcus on tenor and soprano, Gary Pribek on tenor, pianist Barry Keiner and trumpeter Dean Pratt and the songs include inventive versions of &quot;Birdland,&quot; &quot;Bouncin' with Bud&quot; and Horace Silver's &quot;Cape Verdean Blues.&quot; The only weak point to this set is that the playing time is only around 40 minutes since this is a straight reissue of a former LP. Recommended.
