Inspired by the tridentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powers, Freek becomes determined to ascend out of the Netherworld and into Heaven. But, of course, he needs your help. Freek encounters a variety of unusual creatures in his fire-laden underground world. His new-found trident allows him to capture those crazy crawlers and turn them into different tools, depending on their abilities. For example, while an elastic-bed-like monster transforms the trident into a pogo stick, a sharp toothed goblin turns it into a cutting machine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7026b9931921bc46b9bf8e5d9c32fe986c74ea29","amp;dn":"Freekscape+Escape+From+Hell%5BUSA%5D%5BEnglish%5D%5BPSP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7026b9931921bc46b9bf8e5d9c32fe986c74ea29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,38,185,147,25,33,188,70,185,191,142,93,156,50,254,152,108,116,234,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
