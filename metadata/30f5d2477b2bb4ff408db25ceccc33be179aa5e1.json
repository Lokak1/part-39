Shrouded in secrecy and\n feared for their ruthlessness, the Assassins intend to stop the hostilities\n by suppressing both sides of the conflict. Players, assuming the role of\n the main character Altair, will have the power to throw their immediate\n environment into chaos and to shape events during this pivotal moment in\n history.\n\n\nProtection: Safedisc\nRelease date: 02/29/2008\nDeveloper: Ubi Soft\nPlatform: Ubi Soft\nCategory: Action,Adventure\n\n  1.
