Enjoy.\n\nDiscovery was the band's first number 1 album in the UK, entering the chart\nat that position and staying there for five weeks. The album contained five\nhit songs in &quot;Shine a Little Love&quot;, &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot;,\n&quot;Last Train to London&quot;, &quot;Confusion&quot; and &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp&quot; many of\nwhich were heavily influenced by disco (in fact, Richard Tandy came up with\nits well known nickname, Disco Very). &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot; would become\none of their only two top three hits in the UK throughout their career\n(&quot;XanadÃƒÂº&quot; will be number One in 1980) and also their highest-charting US\nsingle at number 4. &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp&quot; was also a hit single in\nthe UK, not patterned after the disco sound; instead it was closer in its\nBeatlesque style to the band's earlier hit &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; The album itself\nwas the first ever to generate four top-ten singles\n(one of which was a Double A-side) from a single LP in the UK and was\neventually certified 2x platinum by the RIAA in 1997.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01.
