The aim of the book is to improve the quality of life for those whose lives are touched by autism, that is, parents of individuals with ASDs, individuals with ASDs, and professionals who work with these individuals, and their families. This is achieved by providing an opportunity for them to &quot;step into each other's shoes and walk around for a while&quot;. The author develops a theory of (different) minds (including a theory of autistic mind (To AM), from the familiar concept of theory of mind (ToM) that facilitations this process. The book provides a wealth of information on all aspects of autism thus providing a comprehensive guide for those new to autism and/or a valuable resource for those familiar with ASDs. In particular it provides a welcome addition to the relatively small corpus of literature written from the perspective of individuals with ASDs or Asperger Syndrome. The book is well researched and the sections on further reading particularly useful for those wanting to know more.'- Educational Psychology'Theory of Mind is the ability to imagine and make judgements about what others feel and think; its absence in autistic individuals is called 'mindblindness'. This book addresses the 'mindblindness' of people united in their interest in autism but divided by their different angles and perspectives. Divided into four parts, the book first defines autism, then the views of the three main groups working with it - autistic individuals, parents and professionals - under the headings of classification, causes, development, theories and treatment. By comparing and reconsiciling the different perspectives in this way, the book helps each group to understand and predict each other's responses and behaviours. This enlightening and innovative book offers a unique way of 'stepping in each other's shoes' and is a valuable resource for all people living or working with autism.'- Link, Autism-Europe\n\nAbout the Author\nOlga Bogdashina, MA Education (Autism), PhD (Linguistics) has worked extensively in the field of autism as teacher, lecturer and researcher, with a particular interest in sensory-perceptual and communication problems in autism.
