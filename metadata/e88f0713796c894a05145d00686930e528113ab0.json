God's main plan was not to create us so that we could become lost so that we could then win each other to Christ.\n\nGod had a far greater purpose in mind when He created man than just soul winning. It is the purpose of this book to enlighten readers to greater heights in their Christian walk. Read and learn your true purpose for existing. You were put here... For His Pleasure!\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Gipp is a former pastor, an evangelist, teacher, author and Bible conference speaker.
