Relix says the Ã¢â‚¬Å“quality of the songwriting and the careful precision of the arrangementsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦brings to mind Dave Matthews Band though Thayer and his band rock much harder.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Seven Days observes that the band Ã¢â‚¬Å“present well-crafted flights of fancy rooted in typically potent songwritingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that push in a new direction Ã¢â‚¬Å“that could attract legions of new fans.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And Farce The Music sums it up this way: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Think early Wilco with a broader sound or a modernized version of The Band and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got an idea of Bow Thayer and Perfect TrainwreckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s M.O.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de6c153fa2735d8ad7131f906ba7c5010e6ad86","amp;dn":"Bow+Thayer+%26amp%3B+Perfect+Trainwreck+-+Eden+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC+%2F+WEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de6c153fa2735d8ad7131f906ba7c5010e6ad86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,230,193,83,250,39,53,216,173,113,49,249,6,186,124,80,16,230,173,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
