Today the group's legacy is played out in an array of Hollywood blockbusters and numerous works of popular literature.\n\n\n\nDespite the Knights' long reign of power, the order experienced a sudden collapse in the early fourteenth century when certain members stood accused of unspeakable crimes and were subsequently tortured and killed. \n\n\nThis insightful program interviews some of the world's leading biblical scholars and visits historic sites throughout Europe and the Near East to probe the past of this mysterious order. Did the Knights, as many believe, guard the Holy Grail? Or was the object of their attentions buried a thousand years before the birth of Christ?\n\n\nThe Templar Code is an in-depth examination into the remarkable rise and rapid descent of the powerful and obscure Knights Templar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Edward Herrmann\n============================\n\n\n\nProduced by: Bernie Dudek,Geoffrey Madeja &amp; Marcy Marzuki \n=========================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Templar Code\nYear.................:    2005\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:26:58\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3  \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1124 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    699 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2005\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493373/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493373/&lt;/a&gt;\n  \n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958a8484cdd6c18bfaccff8bff18c28ccc7a743d","amp;dn":"The+Templar+Code-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958a8484cdd6c18bfaccff8bff18c28ccc7a743d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,138,132,132,205,214,193,139,250,204,255,139,255,24,194,140,204,122,116,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
