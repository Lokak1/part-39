Fabric 41 is out next month.\n\nLuciano is famously averse to CD mixes, but Fabric have managed to twist his arm into delivering the goods. ?For me, the hardest thing to do is make a mix CD. Really,? says Swiss/Chilean minimal star. ?It was a big decision for me to do a CD for Fabric. To me, mixing is about the live moments, it?s about the moment you live with the people: that?s why you choose one record, and this is how you push the music. So to make a mix CD and already have a playlist in my head, it?s something that disturbs me. Then I know I have to play this and that?I feel obliged to do something rather than feeling free to just create something.&quot;\n\n?It was really difficult for me,? he adds. ?I always try to think, ?what music do I like?? and I try to make something a bit more natural. Not too soft or too thin, and not screaming either, but to mix both together. I try to use also a lot of tools, some elements that I can put in and put out, so it?s more like a composition, but it?s still very tough to make a mix feel right. I took a very dance-approach and I tried to make a sort of crescendo, musicwise. It starts a little bit deeper with fewer elements and slowly it modifies and modulates into something more charged and more rhythmic.?\n\nFabric 41 is Luciano?s second commercial mix, and follows up Sci.Fi.Hi.Fi Vol. 2. Like that mix, it begins in minimal territory, slowly building to floor-oriented house climax before finishing on the gentle techno of Chymera?s ?Arabesque?.\n\nTracklist\n\n01 Rhadoo ? Slagare ?
