It details the story of Jack, a young man from Earth who is pulled into a high fantasy parallel universe and has to defeat the evil sorceress Hecubah and her army of Necromancers to return home. Depending on the player's choice of character class at the beginning of the game (warrior, conjurer, or wizard), the game follows three largely different linear storylines, each leading to its unique ending. In the multiplayer, players can compete against each other in various game modes such as deathmatch and capture the flag, or cooperate against computer-controlled monsters in the &quot;Quest&quot; mode introduced with the latest patch. The game was generally well-received by the critics and media.\n\n\nInstall Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n1. Mount or Burn image\n2. Install\n3.
