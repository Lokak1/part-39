Now most of the world is dying from food-related illness. Half the world is dying\nfrom not enough food and the other half from too much nutrient-depleted, calorie-dense food. Times\nhave changed and so has the way we need to look at food, nutrition and our health. Chronic illnesses\nsuch as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer are now the biggest killers in developed\ncountries. The current medical model that focuses on treating, rather than preventing, illness is simply\nnot working. As individuals we need to take responsibility for improving our health.\nFor years, a so-called debate has raged over the relative importance of dietary supplements as a\nmeans of maintaining good health and safeguarding against disease. The debate has, unfortunately, not\nrelied on good science but rather has been fuelled by a very small number of quasi-scientific studies\nthat have been fraught with controversy. Even the Ã¢â‚¬Å“unbiasedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ research findings have often been\nmisrepresented by the medical industry and by popular media in attempts to create the next\ncontroversy. Such an excess of misinformation has led to a strongly divided public and professional\nopinion on the place of supplements in our diet.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AFUfHZD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AFUfHZD.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cb6a86e7c79ab7bc8162fc991c7d948ae35c800","amp;dn":"A+Supplement+a+Day+Keeps+The+Doctor+Away%3A+The+Science+of+Why+We+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cb6a86e7c79ab7bc8162fc991c7d948ae35c800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,182,168,110,124,121,171,123,200,22,47,201,145,199,217,72,174,53,200,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
