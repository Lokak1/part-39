Inspired by the music from his platinum album, ?Rhythm &amp; Gangsta, this feature stars Snoop as Corde, a broke and frustrated grocery clerk who wants out of his dead-end job. Possessing a supreme ability to persuade the opposite sex, Corde realizes his calling when a veteran of the pimp game unexpectedly visits and shows him how to generate serious cash off his untapped talent. With the girl of his dreams on his arm, he takes a voyage into the dangerous lifestyle of prostitution, money, and murder. Corde soon learns that all that glitters is not gold and must choose between the downward spiral of the fast-life and the self-realization of whether he is a pimp or a man. The dynamic ensemble cast includes Hawthorne James (?Five Heartbeats!?) as Corde?s mentor in the pimp life with supporting roles by Larry McCoy (?Malcolm X?), hip-hop recording artist/producer Lil? Jon, and newcomer Shillae Anderson. The DVD is packed with entertaining bonus features and previously unreleased songs that viewers will enjoy long after the credits roll.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a0327f1e2509afff6c7850725ae410261ea3c3","amp;dn":"Snoop+Dogg+Presents+Bossn%5C%27Up+The+Movie+XViD+DVDRip+RapHustle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a0327f1e2509afff6c7850725ae410261ea3c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,160,50,127,30,37,9,175,255,108,120,80,114,90,228,16,38,30,163,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
