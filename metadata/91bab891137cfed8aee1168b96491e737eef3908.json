They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. \r\n\r\nThough a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe Astonishing (2015â€“present)\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 2014, John Petrucci said that Dream Theater were already &quot;planting seeds for album No. 13&quot;. He commented: &quot;There are some song ideas and little things like that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. \r\n\r\nOne of the great things about this career is that you have the opportunity every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying.&quot;\r\n\r\nAccording to James LaBrie, the band headed back into the studio in February 2015 to create its next album, which he said he expected to be released in the fall, followed by another world tour starting January 2016. \r\nMike Mangini announced on hispage that the band would be entering the studio on February 3, 2015, to start production on the new album. \r\nAccording to John Petrucci, the album will not be completed until late 2015 due to the band's tour of Europe in the summer, and it will be released in early 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n \t01&quot;The Gift of Music&quot;   \t4:08\r\n\r\n\r\nBand members\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    John Myung â€“ bass, chapman stick (1985â€“present)\r\n    John Petrucci â€“ guitar, backing vocals (1985â€“present)\r\n    James LaBrie â€“ lead vocals (1991â€“present)\r\n    Jordan Rudess â€“ keyboards, keytar, continuum fingerboard, harpejji, lap steel guitar, iOS apps, seaboard (1999â€“present)\r\n    Mike Mangini â€“ drums, percussion (2010â€“present)[127]\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFormer members\r\n\r\n    Mike Portnoy â€“ drums, backing vocals, percussion (1985â€“2010)\r\n    Kevin Moore â€“ keyboards (1986â€“94)\r\n    Chris Collins â€“ lead vocals (1986)\r\n    Charlie Dominici â€“ lead vocals (1987â€“89)\r\n    Steve Stone - lead vocals (1990)\r\n    Derek Sherinian â€“ keyboards, backing vocals[128] (1995â€“98)\r\n\r\nTimeline","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91bab891137cfed8aee1168b96491e737eef3908","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+The+Gift+Of+Music++%28Single%29+2015+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91bab891137cfed8aee1168b96491e737eef3908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,186,184,145,19,124,254,216,174,225,22,139,150,73,30,115,126,239,57,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
