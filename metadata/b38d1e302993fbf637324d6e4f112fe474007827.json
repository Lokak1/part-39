Shine on You Crazy Diamond was actually about him, and Syd showed up in the middle of its recording with all his hair (including eyebrows) shaved, after not making contact with any of the band members for years. His appearance actually is made reference to in the movie &quot;The Wall&quot;, based on the Pink Floyd album of the same name.\n\nAnyway, enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38d1e302993fbf637324d6e4f112fe474007827","amp;dn":"Syd+Barrett+-+The+Madcap+Laughs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38d1e302993fbf637324d6e4f112fe474007827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,141,30,48,41,147,251,246,55,50,77,110,79,17,47,228,116,0,120,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
