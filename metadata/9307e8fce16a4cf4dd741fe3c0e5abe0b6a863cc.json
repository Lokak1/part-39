Remembering the ideals for which he risked his life, while never forgetting the evils against which he struggled, the now 94-year-old writer and diplomat calls on all of us to take back the rights that have slowly slipped away since the Second World War ended. As sales of this masterful polemic approach a million in France, it is published here for the first time in English. Published by Charles Glass Books, a new imprint of Quartet Books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9307e8fce16a4cf4dd741fe3c0e5abe0b6a863cc","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Time+for+Outrage%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9307e8fce16a4cf4dd741fe3c0e5abe0b6a863cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,7,232,252,225,106,76,244,221,116,31,227,192,229,171,224,182,168,99,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
