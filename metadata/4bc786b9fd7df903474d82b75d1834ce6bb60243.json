As it turns out, he is not truly human either. On a full moon night, he transforms, revealing that he is the last werewolf alive. Despite this, Hana's love remains strong, and the two ultimately decide to start a family.\r\n\r\nHana gives birth to two healthy childrenâ€”Ame, born during rainfall, and Yuki, born during snowfallâ€”both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society. Wolf Children is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc786b9fd7df903474d82b75d1834ce6bb60243","amp;dn":"Wolf+Children+1080p+Dual+Audio+x265+HEVC+-+Prof","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc786b9fd7df903474d82b75d1834ce6bb60243","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,199,134,185,253,125,249,3,71,77,130,183,93,24,52,206,107,182,2,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
