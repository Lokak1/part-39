Apologies to those who tried to download yesterday.\n\nHarry Belafonte's 1959 benefit concert at Carnegie Hall drew raves from the critics and public. RCA's Living Stereo recording was instantly hailed as one of the best-sounding concert recordings of the era and remains highly collectable among audiophiles. Many of Belafonte's hits are here, but it's far more than a singer doing his best-known numbers for adoring fans. It was a coming together of artist, music and audience that would not be rivaled until Judy Garland took the stage at Carnegie Hall some years later. This is a digital version of RCA's Living Stereo 4-track double-play tape version of the two-disc album. No splices. No ticks. No pops. Just great music.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38d40c91fbd84efe441a4b7ced05876e9208f3fb","amp;dn":"Belafonte+at+Carnegie+Hall+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38d40c91fbd84efe441a4b7ced05876e9208f3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,212,12,145,251,216,78,254,68,26,75,124,237,5,135,110,146,8,243,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
