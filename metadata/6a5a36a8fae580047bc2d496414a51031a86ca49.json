Through his eyes and George's words, we look at the human aspect of the struggle for civil rights, the evolution of racism and revisit a period in history where conflict seemed to be the only way to reach freedom and equality.\n\n---\n\n1280x720, 192kbps\n\n---\n\nPlease share this doc anywhere you can!
