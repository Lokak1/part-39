What was once about youth and taking risks\r\nis now about longevity, survival, nostalgia and refusing to grow up, give up or\r\nshut up. But what happens when the music refuses to die and its performers refuse\r\nto leave the stage? What happens when rock's youthful rebelliousness is delivered\r\nwrapped in wrinkles?\r\n\r\nFeaturing contributions from musicians Lemmy, Iggy Pop, Peter Noone, Rick Wakeman,\r\nPaul Jones, Richard Thompson, Suggs, Eric Burdon, Bruce Welch, Robert Wyatt,\r\nGary Brooker, Joe Brown, Chris Dreja of the Yardbirds, Alison Moyet, Robyn Hitchcock,\r\nwriters Rosie Boycott and Nick Kent and producer Joe Boyd.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/22894366905047567813.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/60870165728415772189.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/67008716690921457969.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 578 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO MP3:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 18s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f6c24819d421c172fb3295e6646ab2297ded8a","amp;dn":"BBC+-+ForEver+Young+How+Rock+n+Roll+Grew+up+2010+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f6c24819d421c172fb3295e6646ab2297ded8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,246,194,72,25,212,33,193,114,251,50,149,230,100,106,178,41,125,237,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
