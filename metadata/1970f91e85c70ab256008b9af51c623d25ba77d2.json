Much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple, &quot;Know Thyself.&quot; For us, that also means knowing the Greeks.\n\nIn these lectures we will cover the period from the late Bronze Age, c. 1500 B.C., down to the time of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great, in the late fourth century B.C., concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600 to 400 B.C. The lectures will proceed chronologically and draw on the rich literary and archaeological sources of Greek history, from HomerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s majestic Odyssey to SchliemannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excavations and Troy and Mycenae, from AeschylusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Oresteia to the wealthy Greek colonies of Sicily. Lectures introduce the audience to the world of classical Athens, described in the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides and the dialogues of Plato.\n\nThe lectures explore the similarities and differences between Greek culture and our own. In a variety of areas, such as in religion and gender, the Greeks seem alien, approaching the world in ways utterly different from our ways. In other facets of social life, on the other hand, such as in politics and war, we find a culture perhaps not very unlike our own. We will examine each of these aspects of Greek culture in an attempt to understand better how Greek culture developed as it did, and why it still resonates for us today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1970f91e85c70ab256008b9af51c623d25ba77d2","amp;dn":"TTC+Ancient+Greek+Civilization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1970f91e85c70ab256008b9af51c623d25ba77d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,112,249,30,133,199,10,178,86,0,139,154,245,28,98,61,37,186,119,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
