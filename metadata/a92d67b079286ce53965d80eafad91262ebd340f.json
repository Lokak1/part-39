All the passengers and crew have vanished. When they try to contact the ground they make no connections. They land the plane only to discover that things haven&amp;#039;t changed. But its like the world is dead. No one is there, the air is still, sound doesn&amp;#039;t echo, the food is tasteless. And a distant sound is heard coming closer. A race of monstrous beings bent on their destruction is heading for them, eating everything in sight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a92d67b079286ce53965d80eafad91262ebd340f","amp;dn":"The+Langoliers+%281995%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a92d67b079286ce53965d80eafad91262ebd340f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,45,103,176,121,40,108,229,57,101,216,14,175,173,145,38,46,189,52,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
