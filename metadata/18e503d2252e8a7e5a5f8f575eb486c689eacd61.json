The drummer (who also plays some piano and melodica) is joined for three of his stimulating originals (including &quot;Zoot Suite&quot;) and a pair of John Coltrane songs (&quot;Central Park West&quot; and &quot;India&quot;) by tenor saxophonist David Murray (doubling on bass clarinet), altoist Arthur Blythe, and bassist Peter Warren (who also plays some cello). The challenging frameworks are full of color, variety, and highly expressive moods that push the musicians (both collectively and individually) to play at their very best and most explorative. This was one of the great groups of the late &amp;#039;70s and the finest version of DeJohnette&amp;#039;s Special Edition; highly recommended. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide  \n\n Tony May  Engineer  \n Martin Wieland  Mixing, Mixing Engineer  \n Klaus Detjen  Cover Design  \n David Murray  Clarinet (Bass), Sax (Tenor)  \n Manfred Eicher  Executive Producer, Mixing, Mixing Engineer  \n Arthur Blythe  Sax (Alto)  \n Jack DeJohnette  Drums, Keyboards, Mellophonium, Melodica, Producer, Synthesizer, Guitar, Piano  Peter Warren  Cello, Bass  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e503d2252e8a7e5a5f8f575eb486c689eacd61","amp;dn":"Jack+DeJohnette","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e503d2252e8a7e5a5f8f575eb486c689eacd61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,229,3,210,37,46,138,126,90,95,143,87,94,180,134,198,137,234,205,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
