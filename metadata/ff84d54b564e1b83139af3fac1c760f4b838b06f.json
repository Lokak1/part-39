If you are a lover of Barbra Streisand or Celine Dion, then you are in for a real treat.  \n\n&quot;And So Much More&quot; is Linda Eder&amp;#039;s third album, and in my opinion is her best.  She really pours out the vocals here.  \n\nI strongly recommend this, and any other album she has ever made.  I was surprised not to find this torrent out there, but I have since changed that... \n\nEnjoy and reseed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff84d54b564e1b83139af3fac1c760f4b838b06f","amp;dn":"Linda+Eder+-+And+So+Much+More+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff84d54b564e1b83139af3fac1c760f4b838b06f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,132,213,75,86,78,27,131,19,154,243,250,193,199,96,244,184,56,176,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
