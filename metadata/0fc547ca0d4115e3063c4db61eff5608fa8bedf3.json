The phenomenal response to this mixtape launched not only\nAkalaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career but also gave rise to the Birtish mixtape scene which has gone from\nstrength to strength in recent years.\n\nThe long-awaited War Mixtape Vol. II sees Akala return to his roots as an MC without\nequal. Spitting over some of the most classic hip-hop beats of all time Akala\ndelivers another lyrical master-class on the dark realities of life on the streets of\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œso-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GreatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the self-belief needed to overcome institutional\noppression. At the same time, in a series of venemous battle-raps, Akala leaves no\ndoubt as to who rules the top of the MCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ing roost and challenges anyone who dares to\nstep-up and try to grab his crown. As if that werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enough Akala continues to break\nboundaries by rapping over several beats that may surprise the regular hip-hop\nmixtape crowd including tracks from Radiohead, Artic Monkeys, The Prodigy, Kasabian\nand DJ Shadow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ proving once again that Akala truly is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“rap-rock-electro kidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\n-doubtofalex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fc547ca0d4115e3063c4db61eff5608fa8bedf3","amp;dn":"AKALA.The+War+Mixtape+-+Vol.2+2008+320kbps+VBR+DOUBTofalex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fc547ca0d4115e3063c4db61eff5608fa8bedf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,197,71,202,13,65,21,227,6,60,77,182,30,255,86,8,250,139,237,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
