At the end of the course, a student should feel confident in his or her knowledge of the routing-based topics covered by the CCIE routing and switching written exam, and will have the fundamental knowledge necessary to begin their longer journey to passing the CCIE lab exam. Please note the course is not designed to fully prepare a candidate to sit the CCIE lab exam, but rather to prepare a candidate to pass the written exam and as a stepping stone into lab exam preparation.
