Sometimes exciting, sometimes frightening, these issues always have an emotional side. Author and psychotherapist Dr. Kate Levinson offers fresh approaches to navigating the astonishing range of beliefs about the role of money in our lives, coming to terms with our feelings about being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpoor,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and exploring our inner money life so that we can put our feelings to work for us in a positive way. By understanding our intimate history and relationship with money we are better able to handle our money anxieties, solve our money problems, enjoy the money we have, and make room for other, more meaningful values.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c0514bda15d5ab051243169f0f7ce13b4dab55","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%5D+%5B2011%5D+Emotional+Currency+A+Woman%5C%27s+Guide+to+Building+a+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c0514bda15d5ab051243169f0f7ce13b4dab55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,192,81,75,218,21,213,171,5,18,67,22,159,15,124,225,59,77,171,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
