Addresses for email are extracted from a Domain Naming Server (DNS) and eMail Verifier tries to connect with SMTP-servers and simulates the sending of a message. It does not send the message though - eMail Verifier disconnects as soon as the mail server informs the program whether the address exists or not.\n\n eMail Verifier is your powerful solution for the standard &quot;message delivery error.&quot; Email Verifier verifies every e-mail address from a given mailing list, allowing you to determine 80-90% of &quot;dead&quot; email addresses.\n\n eMail Verifier is a very effective piece of software that can verify over 10 e-mails per second . It can verify single e-mails or huge lists. eMail Verifier is multithreaded, providing high speed verifying.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢virustotalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢infoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/analisis/421b41d9a308c3b0ee02f70f67038552&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/analisis/421b41d9a308c3b0ee02f70f67038552&lt;/a&gt; (7/40)\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢generatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢keyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\n\nVER1-3D3E-484F-7207-4A4B-7465","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933db52a4b0fbd4faef41acc88c388bb032551cb","amp;dn":"Maxprog.eMail.Verifier.v3.5.Multilingual.WinALL.Incl.Keygen-BRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933db52a4b0fbd4faef41acc88c388bb032551cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,61,181,42,75,15,189,79,174,244,26,204,136,195,136,187,3,37,81,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
