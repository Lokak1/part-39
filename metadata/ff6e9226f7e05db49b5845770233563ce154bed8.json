With players controlling the worms in single player or 4-player team games, everyone's armed with a massive variety of wild weapons, as ingenious as they are incendiary.\n\nThe worms' armoury of brilliantly conceived classic weapons return and is built on with even more devilish devices, including the Poison Arrow, Sentry Gun, Tail Nail and the Bovine Blitz, which unleashes a bombing raid of cows. Customize your worm's character in an all new Worms creator feature and unleash annelid annihilation across 25 single-player missions and 20 multiplayer maps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6e9226f7e05db49b5845770233563ce154bed8","amp;dn":"Worms+4%3A+Mayhem+%5BMulti5%5D+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6e9226f7e05db49b5845770233563ce154bed8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,110,146,38,247,224,93,180,155,88,69,119,2,51,86,60,225,84,190,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
