The two masterful pianists perform six vintage jazz standards (including &quot;Dig,&quot; &quot;Stella By Starlight&quot; and &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;) with plenty of swing and spontaneous moments yet without making the ensembles too cluttered or crowded. In addition to their talents, both Flanagan and Barron prove to have very alert ears. Recommended.
