The album presents a darker and generally more experimental sound than the one present in their later albums, and contributed most to the infamous genre controversy of their classification as a death metal or black metal band at the time. A fair helping of black metal was still present, due to Alexi LaihoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stint (as lead guitarist) in Impaled Nazarene and his self-professed Ã¢â‚¬Å“roots being in black metalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nTracklist:\n1. Deadnight Warrior\n2. In The Shadows\n3. Red Light In My Eyes, Pt. 1\n4. Red Light In My Eyes, Pt. 2\n5. Lake Bodom\n6. The Nail\n7. Touch Like Angel Of Death\n\nMedia info:\nVorbis OGG Format\nBitrate 499kbps\n\nEnjoy the Airbourne album and visit GetOggMusic site for the whole discography!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25fa75090b08895a4a5319c3e4daffee018503d3","amp;dn":"Children+Of+Bodom+-+1997+-+Something+Wild+-+OGG%40499kbps+%5BGetOggM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25fa75090b08895a4a5319c3e4daffee018503d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,250,117,9,11,8,137,90,74,83,25,195,228,218,255,238,1,133,3,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
