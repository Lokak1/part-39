William Boyd follows his critically acclaimed novels A Good Man in Africa, Brazzaville Beach, and Ordinary Thunderstorms with a razor-sharp, incandescent thriller in Waiting for Sunrise. A provocative exploration of the line between consciousness and reality is nested within a tense, rollercoaster plotline following as a young English actor ensnared in a bewildering scandal with an enigmatic woman in early twentieth-century Vienna. Sophisticated, page-turning, and unforgettable, Boyd's Waiting for Sunrise is a triumph of literary fiction from one of the most powerful, thought-provoking writers working today.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24a12a292ed45ea026f5ee29e1bd31317474537e","amp;dn":"William+Boyd+-+Waiting+for+Sunrise%2CEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24a12a292ed45ea026f5ee29e1bd31317474537e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,161,42,41,46,212,94,160,38,245,238,41,225,189,49,49,116,116,83,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
