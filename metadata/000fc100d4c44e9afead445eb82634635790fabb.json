Although some of the hits didn't actually make #1 in the UK or the USA, some may have been #1 in several other countries, prompting it to be thankfully included here. &quot;Number Ones&quot; features 19-tracks, adding cuts such as the country flavored &quot;Don't Forget To Remember&quot; (#34 in USA/#2 in UK) and the immortal &quot;Words&quot; (#15 USA/#8 UK). Although the Bee Gees never had these few songs at #1, other artists have consistently placed these songs at the top of the charts.\n\nThe last song is 2001's &quot;Man in the Middle,&quot; a polite MOR rocker and is included as a tribute to the late Maurice Gibb. If you buy this early, you'll get the limited-edition CD/DVD combo which includes rare footage of the Bee Gees performing &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart,&quot; &quot;How Deep Is Your Love,&quot; &quot;Jive Talkin',&quot; &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; (from the U.K. TV show &quot;An Audience With&quot;).\n\nTrivia: Dozens of songs went to #1 in Holland, Germany and Italy and elsewhere. Here are some well-known and rare Gibb songs that have made it to #1.\n\n&quot;Spicks &amp; Specks&quot; (Australia)\n\n&quot;My World&quot; (Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore)\n\n&quot;Run To Me&quot; (Hong Kong, Singapore)\n\n&quot;Saw A New Morning&quot; (Hong Kong)\n\n&quot;Wouldn't I Be Someone&quot; (Hong Kong)\n\n&quot;Love So Right&quot; (Brazil)\n\nThe list goes on and on and will continue to be the legacy of three brothers from Manchester, England.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:000fc100d4c44e9afead445eb82634635790fabb","amp;dn":"Bee+Gees+Number+Ones+Plus+Bonus+Music+Video+320cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"000fc100d4c44e9afead445eb82634635790fabb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,15,193,0,212,196,78,154,254,173,68,94,184,38,52,99,87,144,250,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
