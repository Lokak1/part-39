They released a self-titled independent cassette in 1986 before changing their name to 13 Engines. This name was a reference to the automobile industry in Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan, which were the first two markets to embrace the band.[2]\n\nThey released two independent albums, Before Our Time in 1987 and Byram Lake Blues in 1989, before signing to SBK Records in the United States and EMI in Canada.[2]\n\nTheir major label debut, 1991's A Blur to Me Now, gave the band airplay for the singles &quot;King of Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Big Surprise&quot;. However, SBK dropped them soon afterward.[2]\n\n1993's Perpetual Motion Machine, produced by Critchley,[3] was the band's breakthrough in Canada, spawning the hit singles &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Bred in the Bone&quot; and &quot;Smoke &amp; Ashes&quot;, and led to a spot on The Tragically Hip's Another Roadside Attraction tour.[2]\n\nThey followed up with Conquistador in 1995, which gave them another hit with &quot;Beneath My Hand&quot;.[2] While the album is generally hailed as 13 Engines' finest work, it did not do well commercially[4] and two members subsequently left the band. John Critchley briefly attempted to carry on under the 13 Engines name, but retired the band before releasing another album.\n\nFollowing the breakup of 13 Engines, Critchley continued as a solo artist and recorded an album with ex-13 Engines guitarist Scott Stevenson entitled Crooked Mile in 2000. He currently focuses his attention to producing and engineering at Toronto's Green Door Studios, which he owns.[5] He also scores film and television projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Blur To Me Now 1991\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tBig Surprise\n2.\tSuffocate\n3.\tKing Of Saturday Night\n4.\tAnother Toss Of The Coin\n5.\tYou're Nothing If You're Not Strong\n6.\tAbandoned\n7.\tHurry\n8.\tClear\n9.\tGathered Safely In\n10.\tRolling Home Again\n11.\tElephant Song\n12.\tThrottle Open Wide\n13.\tNight Of The Shooting Star\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerpetual Motion Machine 1993\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tBred In The Bone\n2.\tSaviour\n3.\tMore\n4.\tUnconscience\n5.\tthe Golden Age\n6.\tSmoke and Ashes\n7.\tWhat If We Don't Get What We Want?\n8.\tUnbound\n9.\tPerpetual Motion Machine\n10.\tMoment Of Clarity\n11.\tDirty Little Rat\n12.\tThe Estrangement\n13.\tGoing Under\n14.\tLift You Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConquistador 1995\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tBeneath My Hand\n2.\tReptile Boy\n3.\tMenefreghista\n4.\tSlow\n5.\tNaked\n6.\tVermilion\n7.\tTailpipe Blues\n8.\tSatellite\n9.\tBird Of Prey\n10.\tCootie Girl\n11.\tZone\n12.\tEven The Sailors\n13.\tThe Listener\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bd6872b715b7313ed5c0a69e2adb7d06b16eb0c","amp;dn":"13+Engines+CD+Studio+Discography+1991+-+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bd6872b715b7313ed5c0a69e2adb7d06b16eb0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,214,135,43,113,91,115,19,237,92,10,105,226,173,183,208,107,22,235,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
