What happened to his body as it lay in a funeral home would reveal a story of modern day grave robbery and helped smash a body-snatching ring that had made millions of dollars by chopping up and selling-off over 1000 bodies. Dead bodies have become big business.\n\nEach year millions of people&amp;#039;s lives are improved by the use of tissue from the dead. Bodies are used to supply spare parts, and for surgeons to practice on. Horizon investigates the medical revolution that has created an almost insatiable demand for body parts and uncovers the growing industry and grisly black market that supplies human bodies for a price.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1681 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 672x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.750:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 130kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 48:57.960\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 638MB\nSubtitles: English subtitles\nRipped by: ACook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db4b29122f36aa1b1fc91a7f7c15974fa0bbfe2","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2008+How+much+is+your+dead+body+worth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db4b29122f36aa1b1fc91a7f7c15974fa0bbfe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,180,178,145,34,243,106,161,177,252,145,167,247,193,89,116,250,11,191,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
