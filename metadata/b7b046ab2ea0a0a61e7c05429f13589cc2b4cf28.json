They're not trying to earn a wink from some gal, they're taking over the world, so it helps that their big-hearted myth rock is crafted by three dudes who don't mind getting sweaty out there.  In fact, for the release of their debut LP, Here Be Dragons Vol. III, John, Jeff and Graham trained hard on fundamentals.  That's right, nuts and bolts, bread and butter.&quot;\n\nJohn McGrew - Lead vocals, piano, guitar, trumpet\nJeff Kerestes - Bass, guitar, backing vocals\nGraham Fisk - Drums, backing vocals\n\nTracklist:\n01 - The Inevitable Small Rebellions\n02 - Desire\n03 - Bending The Light\n04 - Act IV\n05 - Pay It Forward\n06 - That Lovers Make\n07 - Sirens\n08 - Vertigo\n09 - Devil In Disguise\n10 - Autumn Song\n11 - Ruby\n\nIf you like their music, support them by buying this album and check out the others (free to listen on mentioned website).
