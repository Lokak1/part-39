You thought you were free? This stuff has been going on forever. The idea was to make us perceive we were &quot;free and independent&quot;, but actually we are still subject to the British Commonwealth. She has a lot of information here, and we are going to have to have her back again for more. I talked to her last night. Just a fascinating individual. She is going to talk about the Montauk Project and extraterrestrial influences, and more. So, Alex, where do\n    you start?\n\n    AC: Somebody told me one time, start in the middle and go from there. If you want to, pick a subject and we&amp;#039;ll start from there.\n\n    DA: Last night we talked about a few things. We talked about the Denver airport last night and what is really going on down there, and we talked a bit about the Montauk project and Al Bielek, and then we skipped around a bit about some of the things in Pandora&amp;#039;s Box. You mentioned that the Queen of England has been buying up a lot of property in Colorado under a pseudonym. Why don&amp;#039;t we start on the subject of the British.\n\n    AC: All right. The information, primarily, that is in Pandora&amp;#039;s Box covers how the major corporations, railroad and banking concerns in this country were set up through a trust that was originally known as the Virginia Company, and there was a survivor to the massacre of the royalty in France during the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette and King Louis&amp;#039; son, the Dauphin, who survived and was smuggled out of France. The Dauphin went to the United States via England, where he signed a contract with the Virginia Company. He came here to help the businesses, especially banking, in the United States. The deal was that everything would remain under English control, or subservient to it, and that brings us right up to today, because we are still looking at everything falling under that trust system going back to the Crown of England. It is mind boggling to think that everyone in this country has been led to believe that the people in the United States had won independence from England, when in fact they never did.\n\n    DA: Well, look at President Bush, wherein two years ago he went to England and was knighted by the Queen. Where is that coming from? Is it that he was a faithful servant?\n\n    AC: You bet. All of them are doing the bidding, and it goes back to their secret societies and the establishment of the New World Order, which all leads back to the house of Windsor. There has been in this country for a long time a grooming process whereby people carry on the bidding of the Crown of England. That is one of the things the system involving the Rhodes Scholars was set up to achieve. Cecil Rhodes set it up to groom people for this task, to carry the United States into the New World Order. It appears, from what I have been able to find out, that the Crown of England has had this very skillfully planned for hundreds of years, and it could be possible that they have been privy to information that not many of us have been for a long long time about the chaos involving Earth changes that is coming. It is my understanding that England is not going to make it through the changes, so they set up a whole new Empire over here. That goes back to some of the things we discussed before, about lands being bought up in Colorado.\n\n    DA: Yes, the area is of a pretty high altitude, where it will be safe.\n\n    AC: Yes. Plus, all the symbolism that is apparent in the layout of the new Denver airport says that it is a control center for world control. There is a lot of &quot;secret society&quot; symbology at the airport. We started researching all of this to find out what it all means. It&amp;#039;s all very scary. A gentlemen by the name of AL Bielek, who has been involved in some very unusual government projects in the past, told me that the Denver area is where the establishment of the Western sector of the New World Order will be in the United States. Little bits and pieces keep coming to me, confirming things I have not had confirmed\n    before.\n\n    DA: Do you know of John Coleman?\n\n    AC: The Committee of 300?\n\n    DA: Yes. What&amp;#039;s your take on that?\n\n    AC: I think his information is fantastic. If he had had the information that I put in Pandora&amp;#039;s Box when I put that together, it would have have blown his mind. But, as far as I know from my standpoint, both sets of material go hand in hand, right down the line.\n\n    DA: Some of these things about the background of the British invasion, taking over the land over here while they let us think that we are running this country. How they had a bone to pick with the Czar of Russia years ago, how they have pushed the socialist revolution....like they say, the sun never sets on British soil. About some of these things on the airport in Denver. Would you mind discussing some of those things again?\n\n    AC: Well, the first thing that got my attention at the airport was the capstone that I saw in a photograph, that had a Masonic symbol on it. So, I really wanted to go to the airport and see that, because I thought it was very unusual.\n\n    DA: The capstone?\n\n    AC: The capstone, or the dedication stone, for the Denver airport has a Masonic symbol on it. A whole group of us went out to the airport to see some friends off and see this capstone, which also has a time capsule imbedded inside it. It sits at the south eastern side of the terminal which, by the way, is called The Great Hall, which is what Masons refer to as their meeting hall. And, on this thing it mentions the New World Airport Commission. I have never heard of that, have you?\n\n    DA: Never.\n\n    AC: It has a Masonic symbol on it, and it also has very unusual geometric designs. It depicts an arm rising up out of it that curves at a 45 degree angle. It also has a thing that looks like a keypad on it. This capstone structure is made of carved granite and stainless steel, and it is very fancy. This little keypad area at the end of the arm has an out-of-place unfinished wooden block sitting on it. The gentleman that was with me on the first trip out to the airport has since died. They say he committed suicide, but everything else tells me that this is no possible. No one can double-tie a catheter behind his own neck and strangle himself. I just don&amp;#039;t think that is possible. But, his name was Phil Schneider, and he started blowing the whistle on all this stuff going on in the underground bases that he had helped build for years and years. He worked on the underground bases at Area 51 and Dulce, New Mexico, as well as several other places. Schneider told me that this keypad-looking area looked like a form of techno-geometry that is alien-oriented, and that it had something to do with a &quot;directional system&quot;, whatever that meant, that functioned as a homing beacon to bring ships right into the Great Hall.\n\n    In the same general area on this capstone, there are some most unusual designs on the floor that are all Masonic in nature, which lead right back to the Black Sun\n\n    (Click here to view floor designs)\n\n    (Editor Note: See the page in LE#91 sent to us referring to this order, in terms of its connection with the Montauk experiments . According to Al Bielek, Schneider&amp;#039;s father was a U-boat captain during the Nazi regime and who was also on the Eldridge in 1943 in a medical capacity), which goes back to Nazi symbology. See, the &quot;secret societies&quot; are supposedly into Sun worship. The Nazi&amp;#039;s were into &quot;Black Sun&quot; worship, which connects with the idea of Saturn. Saturn and Satanism kind of go hand-in-hand.\n\n    Then, we have this system of murals at the airport that are the most grotesque things you&amp;#039;ve ever seen.\n\n    DA: What&amp;#039;s on the murals?\n\n    AC: I say that that they are about what they plan to do to us, and the world as a whole, not what has happened or some fantasy. One of them that is very unusual has three caskets with dead people in them...\n\n    DA: That&amp;#039;s part of the ritual connected with the Skull &amp; Bones Club.\n\n    AC: Yes. There are evidently three groups of people that they would like to see dead. The first casket has what the artist told me was a Jewish-American child, a little girl, and she has the &quot;star&quot; on her clothes and a little Bible and a locket...\n\n    DA: Jewish lineage is passed through the female...\n\n    AC: Yes. Well, all these caskets depict women who are dead. Then, in the center casket there is depicted a Native American woman, and the last casket has a black woman in it. Now, normally I would not have thought too much about these murals if I had not done a lot of research. Even in the government documents I have run across gene-splicing discussions on how they would like to splice out specific races, and also whoever these people are do not\n    like the Jewish people. This is just one of the murals, and these murals are huge.\n\n    This same mural depicts the destruction of a city and the forest, and there is a little girl holding a Mayan tablet that speaks of the destruction of civilization. There is a mural that depicts this &quot;thing&quot; standing over a city that looks like a green &quot;Darth Vader&quot;,with a sword, that has destroyed the city. This character is huge, and there is a road depicted with women walking holding dead babies.\n\n    This same mural extends over to another mural which depicts all of the children of the world taking the weapons from each country on earth and giving them to a central figure which is a German boy who has this iron fist and anvil in his hand that is totally out of proportion to the child&amp;#039;s body, beating the swords into plowshares.\n\n    I thought, well, this is very odd depicting a German child doing this. What all this symbology on the airport murals seems to convey is that not only do we have a secret society behind this, but that it is a German secret society behind this, working in the vicinity of this New World Control Center.\n\n    DA: It is interesting when you consider Operation Paperclip wherein all these Nazi&amp;#039;s were brought to the United States to be groomed, financed, and basically brought back into power.\n\n    AC: Well, I know they&amp;#039;re here, because I have seen them alongside the Americans in the more sensitive areas of the airport. But, these paintings are most disturbing a very unusual. When I first tried to contact the artist and talk to him about these murals, he told me that he was given guidelines on what to paint and put in the murals. When I showed up in his studio, I asked to see the guidelines for the last two murals he was working on, he suddenly went &quot;brain dead&quot; and said &quot;of course, there are no guidelines.&quot; It took myself and two other people over eight months to figure out all the symbology that is embodied in these murals. It turned out that some of these are &quot;trigger&quot; pictures, containing symbology designed to trigger altered personalities of people that have been groomed in MKULTRA type programs for specific tasks that they have been trained to do in terms of something connected with Satanic rituals and mind control. I had one woman that called my out of the blue one night, and she was really disturbed about some information. She told me many different things that later turned out to be known MKULTRA triggers. Also, almost every aspect of these murals contains symbols relating back to secret societies. When you get the overall view of what they are talking about in these things, it is very very scary. It goes back to the Biodiversity Treaty, getting rid of specific races of people, taking over the world and mind control.\n\n    There is one picture in which every plant turns out to be mind-altering or poisonous, and all the animals are Masonic symbols used in literature in every country in the world.\n\n    It took a very long time to track all this stuff down and figure out what they&amp;#039;re trying to say. The one way they tell stories is in pictures. It&amp;#039;s right there in our face when you go into the airport. Most people look at them and say, &quot;boy, those are crazy-looking pictures, what are they doing in this airport?&quot;\n\n    (Click here to view more details from the two murals)\n\n    DA: Now, you mentioned that underneath this airport it goes down many levels.\n\n    AC: Yes.\n\n    DA: Does the fact that all these underground levels are there have something to do with why it took so long for this airport to open?\n\n    AC: Well, the gentleman that I was dealing with, Phil Schneider, said that during the last year of construction they were connecting the underground airport system to the deep underground base. He told me that there was at least an eight-level deep underground base there, and that there was a 4.5 square mile underground city and an 88.5 square-mile base underneath the airport. It is very unusual that they would allot a 50 square-mile area on the surface at which to locate an airport in the middle of nowhere unless they really planned to use it for something very unusual later. There is a 10-mile, 4-line highway out to this airport, and there is nothing out there in between the airport and Denver. Not even a service station, at least in September 1995. The people in Denver are really upset with the fact that this airport went in the way it did.\n\n    There was this fellow who wrote a book in which he made the statement that they had a copy of an audio tape on which a Denver city official was talking with people from the CIA, and that he was paid 1.5 million dollars to allow the &quot;airport&quot; to be built, no matter what it took. It appears that there was a lot more interest in getting the airport built from just officials in the Denver area. They plan on using this facility for something else other than just landing planes.\n\n    DA: So, this guy got you down there to take a look at the underground?\n\n    AC: Well, he was invited to go along on the trip. I had a friend that actually got us down into the active area in the underground. It&amp;#039;s very interesting down there. The baggage equipment area is very unusual. All the old luggage equipment that wouldn&amp;#039;t work right doesn&amp;#039;t look much different than the stuff that is working today.\n\n    DA: You were telling me that there are huge concrete corridors with sprinkers all along the ceiling. What are these sprinkler heads doing in a concrete bunker, pray tell?\n\n    AC: Well, this is the same question we asked. These shafts are huge and run along adjacent to the tramline on both sides. So, there are two of these huge shafts large enough to fit a two-lane highway in there. There ar every few openings into and out of the tram shaft, but at the end of them, going out into this 50 square miles of acreage is a huge steel door that would facilitate the entrance of a great big truck. It could be used for almost anything, but what is so unusual about it is that about every five or six feet on the ceiling, across almost the full width of the area, there is a pipe with three or four sprinkler heads. This goes on for the full length of the thing, which must be close to a mile. There are two of these shafts, and I got picture in the mail the other day which was very unusual that was taken by someone on board the tram in the shaft. The picture appeared to actually show ghost-like figures on it. It was a mother and a baby wrapped in a blanket. When you are down in that concrete shaft, both times I got nauseated. There are some very unusual vibrations down there. Now, the tunnel shaft that the tram comes in on could connect up with an underground tunnel coming in from five buildings that were built and buried. There was already a 40 foot diameter tunnel there when construction started. Those five buildings they built 3 1/2 years ago, and suddenly they said ,&quot;oops, these are in the wrong place&quot; and buried them, along with a very high-tech runway that is buried under about four inches of dirt. It seems insane that they would build a very technical building complex with interlocking tunnels and a tunnel going back to the tram tunnel at the concourse, and then state that they built it in the &quot;wrong place&quot; and cover it up with dirt. I don&amp;#039;t believe that people are that stupid.\n\n    DA: No. Projects like that are strategically planned, and they just don&amp;#039;t go and do that.\n\n    AC: Some of these five buildings are 150 feet tall. There is one 78 feet tall, and one that is 126 feet tall. They are all in that range. &gt;From this complex there is a shaft that runs to concourse &quot;C&quot;. When they started this project, as I said, there was also a huge 40 foot diameter shaft brought in there from omewhere that was off-limits to the work crews. It was there when the project was started. And, everybody that worked on these projects....there were five different\n    contractors, and the people on each contracted crew did not interact with the other ones. When the project was done, everyone was fired and sent away.\n\n    DA: You would think that during this massive construction they would not be able to keep this stuff secret.\n\n    AC: I think a lot of the people saw things that disturbed them so much that they would not talk about it. I know several people who worked on the project that managed to find their way down into the depths, probably close to the deep underground base, and saw things that scared them so badly they won&amp;#039;t talk about it. I interviewed a few of the former employees on these construction crews that worked out there on these buildings that ended up buried, and they are afraid to talk. They say that everybody is real nervous about it, and they decided to tell some of the secrets that they knew, but they don&amp;#039;t want anybody to know who they are. So, I can tell you that it is a very unusual and spooky type of place, and if you are a sensitive person you get nauseated as soon as you enter the perimeter of the airport. Especially when you go down underground. You become very nauseated a nervous. There is also so much electromagnetic flux in the area that if you get out on the open ground around the airport, you will &quot;buzz&quot;.\n\n    DA: Where is this flux field coming from? What do you think the purpose of this is?\n\n    AC: I think that its coming from some kind of underground electrical system, because where we were there were no power lines, and the whole place was just buzzing with this free energy floating around. Very unusual. In addition, there are areas in the underground that have chain-link fences with the barbed wire tops pointed inward, like they were there to keep people in, not keep people out. All these areas are there, acres of it, and none of it is in active use. There are many terraced areas that go down. One area in particular is forbidden to go into unless you are wearing a biological protective suit. They say there is some kind of &quot;unidentified biological fungus&quot; in that area that attacks people&amp;#039;s lungs.\n\n    DA: Hmmm. Some kind of way to hide something that is in this area?\n\n    AC: Well, we think that area is one that leads to deeper levels underground at the airport. But, it is surrounded by a chain-link fence and you can&amp;#039;t get in there. We think this is the area that one of the electricians kind of stumbled into that went down about six levels below the fourth level, and ran into some really weird stuff. He won&amp;#039;t talk about any of it now.\n\n    DA: Real weird stuff.\n\n    AC: Also, at the airport there are what look like miniature nuclear reactor cooling towers, and I don&amp;#039;t understand why they are there. When people asked, the reply is that they are part of the ventilation and exhaust system. Ventilation and exhaust from where?\n\n    DA: What do you think its for?\n\n    AC: I think it is all hooked up to the deep underground.\n\n    DA: They say that this place looks like some underground &quot;holding area&quot;...somewhat like a cattle lot....a place that could hold thousands of people. The gates, fences....\n\n    AC: The luggage transport vehicles move on a full-sized double-lane highway, and along this highway are chain-linked areas that could be used for holding areas. I don&amp;#039;t understand why they built this the way they did, unless they planned to use it for something like that in the future.\n\n    DA: So what could all this be for?\n\n    AC: If Phil is right, and all this hooks up to the deep underground base that he was offered the plans to build back in 1979, and that what this other man told me in private that there is a lot of human slave labor in these deep underground bases being used by these aliens, and that a lot of this slave labor is children. He said that when the children reach the point that they are unable to work any more, they are slaughtered on the spot and consumed.\n\n    DA: Consumed by who?\n\n    AC: Aliens. Again, this is not from me, but from a man that gave his life to get this information out. He worked down there for close to 20 years, and he knew everything that was going on.\n\n    DA: Hmmm. Who do these aliens eat?\n\n    AC: They specifically like young human children, that haven&amp;#039;t been contaminated like adults. Well, there is a gentleman out giving a lot of information from a source he gets it from, and he says that there is an incredible number of children snatched in this country.\n\n    DA: Over 200,000 each year.\n\n    AC: And that these children are the main entree for dinner.\n\n    DA: How many Draconians are down there?\n\n    AC: I have heard the figure of 150,000 just in the New York area.\n\n    DA: Underneath New York?\n\n    AC: Yes. In some kind of underground base there.\n\n    DA: Interesting. Now, you&amp;#039;ve seen pictures of these things?\n\n    AC: I have seen them face to face.\n\n    DA: You have?\n\n    AC: Yes. From some information that has been put out by a group or team that also works in these underground bases that is trying to get information out to people that love this country, there is a war that is going on under our feet, and above our heads, that the public doesn&amp;#039;t know anything about, and its between these alien forces and the humans that are trying to fight them.\n\n    DA: What other types have you seen?\n\n    AC: The ones that I have seen are the big-eyed Greys and the Reptilians.\n\n    DA: What do these Reptilians look like?\n\n    AC: There are three different types.\n\n    DA: Can you tell us how you happened to come into contact with them?\n\n    AC: When I lived in Florida in Panama City, at that particular time the Gulf Breeze sightings were going on, and the area was virtually a hotbed for strange events. I had neighbors that were into watching UFOs and getting information about them. One night about 2:30 am, my neighbor called me and was absolutely frantic, and wanted me to come over there. I ran over there and went in the front door, and she and her boyfriend, who is a commercial airline pilot, were in the living room scared out of their wits. I looked over at her, and her eyeballs are rolling back in her head and she was passing out and sliding down the wall. Her boyfriend was trying to tell me what was going on, and I was feeling this incredible energy that felt like it was trying to penetrate my head. So, I grabbed both of them and pulled them both outside, where we stood for a while and talked...\n\n    DA: Some people would say that this is a case of demon possession...\n\n    AC: Oh, no. There was radiation in the room. The next day all of her plants were dead. So, there was a massive amount of energy focused on that room. Anyway, after about an hour had passed, we had discussed what went on and decided to go back into the house. They had both been in bed and were pulled out of their bed during the night. All they remember is a flash of light in their faces and the next thing they know they&amp;#039;re both scared to death. But, when we went back into the house, I noticed that the man had a small palm-print on his side with fingers that must have been 10 inches long, with claw marks on the end that were burned into his side. The next day, that area was so swollen that he could not touch it. I have video pictures of these things on his side. The prints were there from someone bending down from behind him and pulling him out of bed. They had been laking love, and somebody lifted him off of her and left these burns there.\n\n    Anyway, they were both totally flipped out. I finally got them calmed down enough to ket me go home. I went home and went to bed. The next thing I know, I woke up and there is this &quot;thing&quot; standing over my bed. He had wrap-around yellow eyes with snake pupils, and pointed ears and a grin that wrapped around his head. He had a silvery suit on, and this scared the living daylights out of me. I threw the covers over my head and started screaming....I mean, here is this thing with a Cheshire-cat grin and these funky glowing eyes...this is too much. I have seen that kind of being on more than one occasion.\n\n    DA: What else can you say about it?\n\n    AC: Well, he had a hooked nose and he was very human looking, other than the eyes, and had kind of grayish skin. Later on in 1991, I was working in a building in a large city, and I had taken a break about 6:00, and the next thing I knew it was 10:30 at night, and I thought I had taken a short break. I started remembering that I was taken aboard a ship, through four floors of an office building, and through a roof. There on the ship is were I encountered Germans and American&amp;#039;s working together, and also the Grey aliens, and then we were taken to some other kind of facility and there I saw the reptilians again ... the one&amp;#039;s I call the &quot;baby Godzilla&amp;#039;s&quot;, that have the short teeth and yellow slanted eyes, and who look like a veloci-raptor, kind of.\n\n    DA: So, why would these people pick on you?\n\n    AC: Well, I found one common denominator in the abduction, and it keeps on being repeated over and over again. I deal with lots of people who have been anducted, and the one common denominator seems to be the blood line, and its the blood line that goes back to ancient Indian or Native American blood lines.\n\n    DA: Are these people looking for genetic material?\n\n    AC: Well, I don&amp;#039;t know if it is a very ancient blood line that they want to try and stop, or what the reasoning is. I know that I was asked some questions, like how I was capable of doing some of the psychic things I was doing at the time. But, it is very unusual to find anybody that remotely thinks they have been taken that doesn&amp;#039;t have the Indian blood line, somewhere.\n\n    DA: Now, after that experience, what happened after that? What were some of the other times you saw some of these beings?\n\n    AC: Well, at that facility I saw the almond-eyed Greys, but the thing that sticks in my mind are the beings that look like reptiles, or the veloci-raptors. They are the cruelest beings you could ever imagine, and they even smell hideous. There were a couple of very unusual areas down there where I was taken which looked like cold storage lockers, where these things were in hibernation tubes, and that it about all I remember, other than seeing some black helicopters and little round-wing disk type aircraft. At that point, the memory seems to be cut off and I can&amp;#039;t tap throught to anything else. They&amp;#039;re there, folks.\n\n    DA: Maybe I&amp;#039;ll open up some phone lines, and maybe we&amp;#039;ll talk about Al Bielek and some things you discussed with him. Are you open to that?\n\n    AC: Sure.\n\n    Caller (C): On those ships where the Germans and Americans were, did they have any kind of an insignia on their uniforms?\n\n    AC: Yes, they did. I have been told that the organization is called &quot;The Black League&quot; by people that might know. A blue triangle with a red-eyed black dragon, with a circle around it. It was very unusual. There&amp;#039;s another woman that has written a book about an encounter she had in Fort Walden. I met her some years back, and we were taking about things we&amp;#039;ve seen. She also talked about this strange insignia. She and I both sat down a drew what we saw, and they were virtually carbon copies of each other. (Editor Note: See the symbol on the shirt sleeve of the Israeli soldier comforting the Rabin&amp;#039;s daughter at his funeral in Israel, shown in Newsweek 11/20/95. Winged serpent similar to that seen by Herbert Schirmer and reprinted in Crux #4 in 1989. The comparison will be shown in Leading Edge #92).\n\n    In the book Cosmic Conflict, the author talks about the ancient city that was uncovered by the Germans before World War II, and tells about their effort to revive some frozen humans they found in this underground city, and that the true humans couldn&amp;#039;t be revived, but the ones that could be revived were in fact reptilians in disguise, and they reptilians have the capability to do shape-shifting and create a holographic image so when you look at them you see a human, but under that there is a human there. It&amp;#039;s like a &quot;deja vu&quot; of the movie They Live. Cathy O&amp;#039;Brien, who wrote Trance-Formation in America, revealed that George Bush projected a hologram that he was a reptilian .... real crazy stuff, but if this technology that they possess is there, why couldn&amp;#039;t a race do something like that ... these people that are working with our government?\n\n    C: I believe that, but I do believe that these are demons that manifest themselves as alien beings, and that this has been going on for a long time...\n\n    DA: Demons? Who are demons?\n\n    C: Fallen angels.\n\n    DA: The reptilians look like that anyway. All the scriptures around the planet talk about serpent beings. What do you think, Alex?\n\n    AC: Well, I think that&amp;#039;s pretty much what the bottom line is. Also, they talk about the rapture...\n\n    DA: It could be like an alien &quot;thanksgiving&quot;.\n\n    AC: These people that have done all this research and are part of the underground government are telling that the humans on this planet have been at war with these reptilian aliens for thousands of years. At one point, things got so hot on the planet, like it is now, aliens took on this holographic image and infiltrated the human race in order to take it over and undermine it, just like this New World Order is doing right now. They&amp;#039;re saying that the same thing happened to civilization on Earth before, and that the humans before actually had the capability for interplanetary travel, and that it was so bad here with the reptilians that they had to leave.\n\n    DA: I think that this has been going on for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n    AC: Yes. What they are also saying is that these beings that are human-looking that are visiting our planet, at this time, trying to inform people what is going on, and guide them, are actually our ancestors that escaped the Earth before when it was under reptilian domination.\n\n    DA: What is your take on these crop circles?\n\n    AC: Oh, the crop circles that are the real ones are a type of geometric language containing some kind of information. There was one that was a Mandelbrot fractal. How do you fake that? They say that there are a lot of crop circles going on in the United States, and that the government shuts the information off about their occurrance.\n\n    DA: Canada and Australia as well.\n\n    C: It seems that we are having an increase in these encounters and sightings.\n\n    AC: Things are escalating at an incredible rate. I think a lot of these movies in the media are trying to get us softened up for what they plan to unleash on us.\n\n    C: So, in just a matter of years, they plan to bring it out and bring people to that airport?\n\n    AC: You know, Reagan said more than once that the only thing that would bring people together would be some kind of &quot;outside force&quot;.\n\n    DA: Exactly, I remember that. He said that several times.\n\n    AC: I went to South Florida a couple of weeks ago and interviewed a man who had done research for 30 years, and oddly enough, he tapped into some of the same information I had, in that our government has had round-winged, saucer-type technology, high mach speed aircraft since the 1920&amp;#039;s, and that in 1952 they had over 500 of these aircraft hidden in secret bases. Now, if they had that in 1952, considering that military technology grows by 44 years for every year that goes by, what do you imagine they have now, 44 years later, after technology has advanced the equivalent of 1,936 years?\n\n    C: About two or three months ago, I went to do a business transaction with a fellow I have known for about two or three years, and one of his relatives had just died -- we were pretty close, and we got into a deep conversation about stuff, and he told me he worked in an underground military base in Colorado. I asked him what he did there, and he said that if he did he&amp;#039;d have to kill me. I told him I didn&amp;#039;t want to know. I was really shocked, and didn&amp;#039;t know what to think of it, and then I heard this program. I want to know what your guest thinks about the Iron Mountain report the government did in the 1960&amp;#039;s, and if that ties into the Nazis and the American&amp;#039;s working together. Also, this would also explain George Washington&amp;#039;s vision where this country was invaded from the East by a foreign power, and then when all hope seemed lost, the angels of God would come down and the nation would be saved. Anyway, I never could understand why angels of God would come down and fight with men to save a puny little country that has been around for only 200 years, but in this scenario, there seems to be some explanation here.\n\n    AC: Yes, the Iron Mountain report. The guy that claims to be the author of it now claims that it was nothing more than a joke, but for a joke, it seems to be following the time line to the hilt, so I think it was something that made its way out and they are trying to cover that up. Everything that was in that report is happening in great detail right now.\n\n    C: Do these reptilians bleed if they get shot?\n\n    DA: Has anybody ever killed one?\n\n    AC: Phil Schneider did. He killed several of them. When he was involved cutting some tunnels at Dulce, he was lowered down a shaft and ended up in a nest of these things. He and some of his team were in there, and some of the Delta Force came in. They had a shootout with these aliens, and he killed a couple of them before they got a round off and shot him with some sort of laser weapon. He used to pull his shirt up and show me where they darned near blew a hole in his chest with whatever kind of laser weapon they were using.\n\n    DA: So they can be killed, then?\n\n    AC: Yes, if you have the drop on them. They die just like everyone else. They consist of mass just like we do.\n\n    C: It is interesting that high officials in the Clinton administration, like Cisneros, were deeply involved with the construction of this airport. Also, Pat Shroeder. All of a sudden, she&amp;#039;s leaving office. It&amp;#039;s like a lot of people who have been involved with this airport are leaving town. Also, there is a fellow by the name of Rodney Stitch, who writes about the total corruption in the Denver area. Does this tie in with what you were talking about?\n\n    AC: Well, he is the one that wrote the book Defrauding America. He said that they had a tape of a CIA agent paying off the mayor of Denver to get the airport built. There is just so much corruption. They are selling the good American people out. We have some of our own people selling the rest of population out for a few pieces of gold.\n\n    DA: What about Al Bielek and how what he is saying may relate to this?\n\n    AC: I met Al about a year ago.\n\n    DA: Who is Al Bielek?\n\n    AC: He claims to be one of the ones who jumped overboard off the Eldridge when it went into hyperspace during the Philadelphia Experiment. He actually travelled forward in time, and asked the people that he encountered there what happened in his future. At that time, he was given the information about the New World Order and that Denver was the location for the NWO Western Sector, and that Atlanta was supposed to be the control center for the Eastern Sector. Can it be that the fact that the Olympics is supposed to be in Atlanta is part of a scenario? All the highways in Atlanta have high-security monitoring cameras just like those seen in some of the underground areas at the Denver airport. These monitors are all over the interstate highway and on many of the streets in Atlanta. Last week, I was talking to a fellow who was actually working on the Olympic project, in terms of the main stadium, and he said that they&amp;#039;re gearing up for the possibility of terrorist acts. Do they know something we don&amp;#039;t know?\n\n    DA: Maybe they want to go ahead and perpetrate something again. One thing after another. It&amp;#039;s all part of their scenario. Let&amp;#039;s take a call.\n\n    C: Yes, I would like to thank you and your guest for coming foward with this information. And, as unbelievable as it is for the audience, I personnally have had first-hand experience with some of this stuff. Not so much with the reptilians, but when you talk about this technology base that the government is working with, my own encounters with this technology were basically terrifying, in that I didn&amp;#039;t know what was going on. I got indoctrinated into some type of mind control program that was perpetrated on me. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It&amp;#039;s amazing to me that this stuff is going on, and I know that it is frustrating to get people to wake up to this. I am a little nervous here. I runs a little deeper than just on a physical level of threat. I think a lot of this stuff is not just about suppressing our minds and will to resist the government. It&amp;#039;s about getting our minds to the point to where we&amp;#039;re so &quot;droned down&quot; that we have no chance of reconnecting with the source. I think this whole thing has to do with us on a soul level.\n\n    AC: That&amp;#039;s right. That&amp;#039;s what it&amp;#039;s all about. It&amp;#039;s the last great adventure to control the space between our ears and to eventually take over our souls. I also think that a lot of the people who have sold us out and are involved in this have no idea what the BIG picture is, because it is all so compartmentalized. This is a very demonic scenario that is going on here.\n\n    C: That is why I will spend the rest of my days trying to bring this to people&amp;#039;s attention. My take on it is that if you don&amp;#039;t make the cut when all of this comes to a climax, and they do achieve that ultimate control, your chances of reconnecting are delayed indefinitely.\n\n    AC: Well, you know, we have some beings that are waiting for people to ask, en masse, for help, and they are there, and they will help, but we have to ask for help, because they honor free will.\n\n    C: My previous experience was pretty nightmarish, but I did get through this, and my perspective on God is a gift.\n\n    DA: Alex, how do we get ahold of your book, Pandora&amp;#039;s Box?\n\n    AC: You can write to Pandora&amp;#039;s Box, 2663 Valleydale Road, Suite 126, Birmingham, Alabama 35224. Pandora&amp;#039;s Box Volume One is $50 ($80 Overseas), and Pandora&amp;#039;s Box Volume Two is $35 ($65 Overseas). The book called The Cosmic Conflict is $40 ($75 Overseas). These are big\n    books, with lots of information.\n\n    DA: Well, Alex, thank you for being here, and we&amp;#039;ll have you back here again. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4689e3535dc26c4799917af068d48dd8f5751c3","amp;dn":"PANDORA%5C%27S+BOX+by+Alex+Christopher+%28better+OCR+edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4689e3535dc26c4799917af068d48dd8f5751c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,104,158,53,53,220,38,196,121,153,23,175,6,141,72,221,143,87,81,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
