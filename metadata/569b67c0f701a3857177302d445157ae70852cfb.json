That they're       \n    both kids makes us dismiss it as a          \n    meaningless crush. But a few years later,   \n    the boy is still in love with the girl,     \n    Zoya (Sonam Kapoor). When she's in school,  \n    he follows her around holding her hand and  \n    getting slapped in the process. Finally,    \n    she relents because of his &quot;consistency&quot;.   \n    The film shifts cities when Zoya gets into  \n    JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University), and      \n    through her, we are introduced to the       \n    idealistic and political culture of the     \n    place. She discovers a long-lost strength as\n    she confronts and then falls for student    \n    leader Akram (Abhay Deol). The film takes   \n    a turn when Zoya returns to her hometown    \n                                                \n                                                \n     IMDB Link :                                \n                                                \n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2359810/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2359810/&lt;/a&gt;    \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/4631/ti13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/4631/ti13.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3844/1id.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3844/1id.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/7493/4tn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/7493/4tn.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/5127/t8x.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/5127/t8x.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569b67c0f701a3857177302d445157ae70852cfb","amp;dn":"Raanjhanaa+-+DVDScr+-+x264+-+AC3+-+SAP++%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569b67c0f701a3857177302d445157ae70852cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,155,103,192,247,1,163,133,113,119,48,45,68,81,87,174,112,133,44,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
