She started to explore the world of music when she turned 18 and met famous Shanghai electro musician, Jiayang Yixi in 2005. Together, they spent 2 years creating music together. The result of this collaboration is her debut album entitled 'Easy World', released at the end of 2007 by SOMA ART. In live performances, she immediately attracted the attention of many of the best musicians to join her on stage. Thanks to VJ Fan, her concert is both an auditory and visual joy.\n\nDebut Album:\n\nZhong Chi decided to use music to express her concern with environmental and animal protection. When the voice is devoid of sappy romance, without any emotional falsities, we are more easily moved by the power of music. For anyone who has ever led with the heart and soul, 'Easy World' brings us more than auditory pleasure: more importantly, this record is Zhong ChiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal reflection from traveling in the world. It is like the feeling of being unable to cry but wanting to, or when a person forgets how to smile, or the coming and going of someone that leaves no trace; like a gust of wind. Zhong Chi discovers that nothing in this world will ever change. The only thing she can control is herself. This is not meant to be preachy or haughty, nor is this an embellished romantic clichÃƒÂ©; the music simply carries honesty as well as its own temperature; sometimes warm, sometimes cold.\n\nThe album 'Easy World' was released worldwide on Dec. 21th 2007. Words do not suffice to define and qualify the musical style of this album, which is, after a production period of two years, a testimony to the independent and unique conceptual abilities of independent music company SOMA-ART and producer Jamyam-Yeshe, as well a straightforward expression of the new generationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attitude towards life. \n\n==========================================================================\n\nThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ~Siddhartha\n\n#KeepSeeding!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8b2e7a0076a01cd21bfa71ebbeb42e216d8b5de","amp;dn":"Zhong+Chi+-+Easy+World+%282007%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8b2e7a0076a01cd21bfa71ebbeb42e216d8b5de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,178,231,160,7,106,1,205,33,191,167,30,187,235,66,226,22,216,181,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
