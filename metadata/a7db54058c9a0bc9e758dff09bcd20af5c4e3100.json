This dramatic quality difference is from re-transferring original film and audio from the Merry Prankster vaults in Hollywood. Featuring added scenes, new songs, new interviews, and now synched sound. Featuring the Dead (Pigpen, Jerry, Bobby, Phil and Bill), Ken and the Merry Pranksters (Cowboy Neal, Mountain Girl, Babbs, Hassler, Betsy Flagg, George Walker, Gretchen Fetchin and of course Owsley, the man behind the stereo and the electric punch). In this special &quot;Directors Cut&quot; the Prankster pose as moviemakers, &quot;simply shooting a party scene&quot;. Their planning is interrupted en-route to the event, to hide the stash, because a patrol car has spotted Furthur. Pigpen improvises as the amplifiers around the room find &quot;Power&quot;. Naturally you are treated to plenty of Dead (Warlock) classics and Prankster craziness. As the night builds, and the Kool-Aid kicks in, newly crystallized minds melt with the colors and music. Eventually the Ballroom manager attempts unplugging this electronic mayhem, but they can't see to turn anything or anybody &quot;off&quot;. This exiting slice of history is everything Tom Wolfe wrote about, and more (like Jerry sweeping up after the show). \n\nApprox. 55 min.,  \n\n============================\nType: DVDRip\nVideo: anamorph 4:3, 684x466@684x512, 23.976 fps, DivX Codec 6.9.2 ~1998 kbps avg, 0.26 bit/pixe\nAudio: 48 kHz, AC3 Dolby Digital, 2/0 (L,R) ch, ~192 kbps  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7db54058c9a0bc9e758dff09bcd20af5c4e3100","amp;dn":"Acid+Test+-+Ken+Kesey+And+The+Merry+Band+of+Pranksters+-+1999+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7db54058c9a0bc9e758dff09bcd20af5c4e3100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,219,84,5,140,154,11,201,231,88,223,240,155,205,32,175,92,78,49,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
