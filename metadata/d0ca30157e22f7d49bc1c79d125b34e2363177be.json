The former military surgeon Dr. Hans Mertens (Ernst Wilhelm Borchert) returns home from the battlefield to find his home destroyed. He suffers from the terrible memories of the war and becomes an alcoholic. A photographer and Nazi concentration camp survivor, Susanne Wallner (Hildegard Knef), finds him living in her apartment as she returns home and they soon become friends and roommates. Eventually, Mertens meets his former captain Ferdinand BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner (Arno Paulsen), who had been responsible for the shooting of 36 men, 54 women, and 31 children on Christmas Eve of 1942 in a Polish village on the Eastern Front. He is now a successful businessman, producing pots out of old Stahlhelme, the German military steel helmet. On Christmas Eve, Mertens tries to kill him, but Wallner stops him at the last minute. She convinces Mertens to have BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner put on trial, and the two start a new life together.\n\nDVDRip / 987.1 MiB\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 1.498 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: AC3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 192 kbps CBR 48 KHz\nAspect Ratio: 1.33 (640 x 480)\nFrame Rate: 25.000 FPS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038769/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038769/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ca30157e22f7d49bc1c79d125b34e2363177be","amp;dn":"Wolfgang+Staudte+-+Die+M%C3%83%C2%B6rder+sind+unter+uns+aka+The+murderers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ca30157e22f7d49bc1c79d125b34e2363177be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,202,48,21,126,34,247,212,155,193,199,157,18,91,52,226,54,49,119,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
