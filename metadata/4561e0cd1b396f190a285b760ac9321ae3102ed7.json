They hosted them on Demonoid, but that site is currently down.  I figured I should upload it here anyways.\n\nThe quality is very good mp3.  256kbps if not outright 320kbps.\n\nTracklisting (Song - Artist):\nNote: Reverie is both the name of a song by Our Blistered Horizon, and the name of a band.\n\nJourney Of A Leaf Boat - Haze\nAs We Walk Through Landscapes - Dayviewer\nBilbo - Swaylone\nSix Towers Aside - Peter Caesar\nWith My Heart In My Hands - Passing September\nIf These Mountains Could Speak - nÃƒÂ©e\nBlissful - Euphoric Noise\nReverie - Our Blistered Horizon\nFool's Knoll - Mr Tumnus\nAnother Summer Fades - Reverie\nLaughing - Ask the Axis\nBlurry (Part III), Like Insects Drowning in Puddles - The Anatomy of Frank\nSome Questions Are Better Left Unanswered - In July, The Republic Fell\nUntitled 2 - Swaylone\nNo Monsters In My Dreams - Aberrant Corollary\nMonument - Our Blistered Horizon\nConcrete Floors - Synaesthesiacs \nAs Dark Clouds Look, We Must Stand Firm - Reverie\n\nThis is technically the second of two albums comprising Post-Rock Album 3.  I will eventually upload the first, but I think this one is better.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4561e0cd1b396f190a285b760ac9321ae3102ed7","amp;dn":"Post-Rock+Album+3%3A+Came+Respite","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4561e0cd1b396f190a285b760ac9321ae3102ed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,97,224,205,27,57,111,25,10,40,91,118,10,201,50,26,227,16,46,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
