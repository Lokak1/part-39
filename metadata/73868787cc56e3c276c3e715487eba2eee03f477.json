The WINDOWS folder for this &quot;TinyXP&quot;\n\ttakes up only 420Mb space on your systems hard drive\n\tand Windows TinyXP runs on just 60Mb of RAM.  Windows\n\tXP usually uses much more RAM than this.\n\n\tAll Included Hotfixes Were Updated On 26th December 2005\n\n\t99% of the functionality is left remaining in Windows.\n\n\tAll important hardware drivers and other essentials\n\thave been kept in this release - You have joystick\n\tsupport, printer support and other bare essentials.\n\t&quot;Microsoft SideWinder&quot; support has been left in.\n\n\tYou can use Microsoft Office with this Tiny edition\n\tof Windows XP, because the Jet Database Engine is kept.\n\n\tYou still have MS Paint, Calculator and Wordpad.\n\n\tYou still have XP&amp;#039;s games: FreeCell, Hearts,\n\tMinesweeper Solitaire and Spider Solitaire.\n\tInternet games that were included in XP HAVE\n\tbeen removed in TinyXP.  \n\n\tInternet Explorer has been removed from this edition,\n\tit is GONE! Included is a tiny standalone web browser\n\t(OffByOne or OB1) so you can at least access the internet\n\tto download a good browser like Firefox or Opera, both these\n\tgreat browsers are FREE and offer more security over Internet\n\tExplorer. The &quot;core&quot; of Internet Explorer HAS been left in\n\tthis edition.\n\n\tThe core player &quot;Windows Media Player 6.4&quot; is also kept,\n\tthis should play most video files. If you want a really good\n\tand free media player, use &quot;VideoLAN&quot; player, this is not\n\tincluded in TinyXP because it takes about 20Mb of space but\n\tthat is because it plays everything, even DVD&amp;#039;s! Just visit...\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://mirrors.ircam.fr/pub/videolan/vlc/0.8.4a/win32/vlc-0.8.4a-win32.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://mirrors.ircam.fr/pub/videolan/vlc/0.8.4a/win32/vlc-0.8.4a-win32.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\tIncluded with TinyXP is a standalone BitTorrent client, uTorrent. This\n\tamazing BT client is only 130Kb and is packed with functionality.\n\n\tGONE also are all Windows noises like startup and\n\tshutdown noises, but audio does work. Remember, you\n\tcan use Microsoft Office and you DO have support if \n\tyou want to install a printer - also included is...\n\n\tDHCP - Kept! Now your &quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol&quot; \n\twill resolve all dynamic IP&amp;#039;s properly (automatically)\n\t\n\tETHERNET LAN DRIVERS - Kept! Now if you have\n\ta LAN card you won&amp;#039;t have problems!\n\n\tFRONTPAGE EXTENSIONS - Kept! Now you can author websites with Frontpage!\n\n\tJET DATABASE - Kept! Now you can use your beloved Microsoft Office\n\n\tLAPTOP SUPPORT - Battery Support is kept, laptops are now supported!\n\n\n\t\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\tThis XP has been thoroughly tweaked to give you the\n\tbest possible eXPerience from a tiny package. \n\n\tHere is what keeps this OS running FAST as hell - there\n\tare 37 &quot;installed&quot; programs with TinyXP, but these programs\n\tare only COPIED to your hard disk.  All programs are STANDALONE\n\tprograms, except for WinRAR. So, the point to this is, the Windows\n\tregistry stays small, because nothing has installed into the\n\tregistry or into Windows - only if you run the program, then it\n\tmight put whatever keys into the registry it needs to, but the\n\tsize of the registry is just 2.2Mb to begin with!\t\n\n\tIf you do not want ANY of the installed programs at all,\n\tthey can all be directly deleted from &quot;Program Files&quot; apart\n\tfrom WinRAR, that one program would have to be uninstalled\n\tin &quot;Add Remove Programs&quot;. Then delete each folder from the\n\tstart menu that related to the programs you just deleted.\n\tBe careful not to delete any folders Windows might have put\n\tin &quot;Program Files&quot;. Only delete what is included in the list\n\tof programs above, just not WinRAR, because it was actually\n\tinstalled and not just copied to Program Files.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\tVisit/join the Retestrak forums...\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.retestrak.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.retestrak.nl&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\t\tTinyXP Rev02 by &quot;eXPerience&quot;\n\n\t\tBuild Date: 27.01.2006\n\n\t\tRelease Date : Late Winter 2006 (27.01.2006)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73868787cc56e3c276c3e715487eba2eee03f477","amp;dn":"Windows+TinyXP+Rev02+-+best+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73868787cc56e3c276c3e715487eba2eee03f477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,134,135,135,204,86,227,194,118,195,231,21,72,126,186,46,238,3,244,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
