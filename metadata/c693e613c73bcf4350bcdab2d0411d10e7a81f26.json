Using DroidSheep any user â€“ even without technical experience â€“ can check if his websession can be attacked or not. For these users it is hard to determine, if the data is sent using HTTPS or not, specially in case of using apps. DroidSheep makes it easy to check this.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does that work this simple?\r\nThere are many users that do not known that air is the transmission medium when using WiFi. Therefore information is not only transfered to its receiver but also to any other party in the network within the range of the radio waves.\r\n\r\n \r\nUsually nothing special happens because the WiFi users discard packets that are not destined to themselves. DroidSheep does not do this. It reads all the packets looking at their contents.\r\nIs a website sending a clear recognition feature within a messageâ€™s content, which can identify a user (â€œSessionIDâ€), then DroidSheep is able to read it although it is not intended to external users. Moreover DroidSheep can use this token to use it as its own. The server canâ€™t decide whether the authorized user or DroidSheep has sent the request.\r\n\r\n \r\nHow can I protect myself?\r\nThe only satisfying answer is: SSL respectively HTTPS.\r\nMany providers already offer HTTPS, evenhowever it must often be enabled in the settings first.\r\nWhen using HTTPS the data are still sent to alle participants in the WiFi-network, too, but because the data has been encrypted it is impossible for DroidSheep to decrypt the contect of a message â€“ remaining only a complete mess of letters, with which an attacker canâ€™t do anything.\r\nThe real problem is that not every website provides SSL. What to do when you are in a public network (hotel, airport, etc.), you also want to use this and the site does not offer HTTPS though?\r\nYou can use a VPN-connection\r\nFor this the computer sets up an encrypted channel to a confidential computer which again transfers the data to the website.\r\n\r\nThis page should give a briefly overview about the problem.
