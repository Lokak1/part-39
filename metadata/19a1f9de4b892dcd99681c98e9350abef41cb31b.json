The songs are wonderfully constructed, introspective pieces that are lyrically deep and often dark in tone, but this is countered by a lightness of touch in the arrangements and some delicate and memorable melodies. These qualities make the songs immediate and accessible but with the lyrical depth to reward thought-provoking repeated listens. The instrumentation is mainly acoustic and includes a variety of guitars, fiddle, banjo and melodeon and these give the songs a subtle folk edge without being overly rooted in the tradition--she strikes the perfect balance of sounding contemporary but with identifiable folk roots. While the disc contains both dark and light, it's the darker songs that really stand out. Faultlines is a beautifully crafted disc that has been thoughtfully put together--her voice is clean and expressive, and the songwriting is excellent throughout. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp \n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19a1f9de4b892dcd99681c98e9350abef41cb31b","amp;dn":"Karine+Polwart...Faultlines%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19a1f9de4b892dcd99681c98e9350abef41cb31b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,161,249,222,75,137,45,205,153,104,28,152,233,53,10,190,244,28,179,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
