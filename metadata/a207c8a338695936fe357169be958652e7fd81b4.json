Though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well-schooled and widely-traveled in a variety of genres -- from hearftelt folk to buoyant pop to boho jazz to straightforward rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll, and beyond -- Freund ultimately comes across simply as a singer-songwriter with his own singularly distinctive and engaging voice. \n\nCollapsible Plans, FreundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth full-length album, puts that voice -- in terms of both his artistic identity and his evocative singing -- front-and-center. Produced by his longtime friend Ben Harper, and featuring piano and vocal contributions from Jackson Browne on two tracks, Collapsible Plans is FreundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most focused and fully realized recording to date, combining top-shelf musicianship with the strongest set of songs Freund has yet gathered on a single disc. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½I wanted to make a record for a long time that really felt like Ã¢â‚¬Ëœa time and a place,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the way records used to be made,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Freund says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“My last couple were done in different states and with different folks; this one feels very tangible to me and my life at this time. It was great having Ben in the room with me; I trusted his sensibilities as a fellow songwriter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nPerhaps the most telling aspect of FreundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs is that Ã¢â‚¬Å“I just walk away singing them constantly,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Harper observes. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tom has written consistently strong songs for as long as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known him.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve known each other for nearly two decades, and in 1992 recorded the limited-release Ben Harper &amp; Tom Freund LP Pleasure And Pain, which helped to launch HarperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. Freund subsequently spent several years playing bass with acclaimed roots-rock band the Silos before striking out on his own with North American Long Weekend, his 1998 solo debut on the Mercury subsidiary Red Ant Records. \n\nSince then, Freund has alternated between recording and touring behind his own discs (2001Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Sympatico and 2005Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ s Copper Moon, plus a couple of EPs) and playing upright bass, electric bass guitar, and mandolin with the likes of British pub-rock great Graham Parker and rising groove-soul sensation Brett Dennen. (YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even find him on a couple of tracks from pop star Mandy MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2007 disc Wild Hope.) \n\nA 2006 summer tour with Harper helped rekindle the old friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ collaborative spirits, which led to Harper getting involved as producer of Collapsible Plans. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always been a fan of TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, and I thought that I had something to bring to Tom sonically that was maybe a place he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stepped into yet,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Harper says. \n\nTwo tracks on Collapsible Plans feature the unmistakable piano and vocal contributions of Browne, who Freund had recently met at a show. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jackson and I were both asked to perform at a benefit for our friend Wally Ingram in the Hollywood Hills,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Freund recalls. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I got up and started to play Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhy Wyoming,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which I had just written, and by the second verse I hear this amazing piano, and then by the second chorus I hear these amazing vocals. I turn around, and there is Jackson, like an old friend, jamming on my little song as if we had done it a thousand times before!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nThe songs on Collapsible Plans also benefit greatly from the musicianship of Harper, who played lap steel and sang backup on many tracks as well as adding occasional touches of percussion, vibes, Wurlitzer, mandocello, and harmonium. Others who contributed to the recording include guitarist Michael Ward and keyboardist Jason Yates of HarperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band the Innocent Criminals, as well as drummer Michael Jerome and keyboardist Fil Krohnengold. \n\nTheir playing provides an exquisite and fitting frame for FreundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s captivating compositions. Ã¢â‚¬Å“What really brought me to wanting to work with Tom in the studio is his songs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Harper concludes. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to even go any further than that. As far as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m concerned, who wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wanna work with him in the studio? Because the songs are there.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ .\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a207c8a338695936fe357169be958652e7fd81b4","amp;dn":"Tom+Freund+-+Collapsible+Plans+%5B2008%5D%5BEAC%2CLog%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a207c8a338695936fe357169be958652e7fd81b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,7,200,163,56,105,89,54,254,53,113,105,190,149,134,82,231,253,129,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
