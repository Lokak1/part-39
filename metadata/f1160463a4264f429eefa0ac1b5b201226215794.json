After writing several letters to Mike Pryor asking about work and disability compensation, of which none were answered, Harold decides to kidnap Mike for a $100,000 ransom. But since Harold and Irene have never met or seen Mike Pryor, they abduct Kimble instead, after seeing Mike's son, Glenn, give more affection to Kimble than his distant father.
