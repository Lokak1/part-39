It is a horror film starring Leslie Nielsen, Mark Richman and Judi Meredith set in San Francisco in 1890 concerning playboy sleuth Brett Kingsford (Nielsen). Kingsford is an expert on the supernatural and along with his dwarf assistant Nicola he helps the police uncover the scheme of a Sumerian demon to return to earth and take over a human body.\n\nThis atmospheric black and white film is only 59 minutes long and was directed by Harvey Hart. It was the pilot for a failed television series called The Black Cloak and was written by BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Lyndon. In plot and character it greatly resembles Chamber of Horrors, which was made the next year and had a similar fate.\n\n\nThis is a much better version than the last one I posted,\n\n\naapnhaabo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56dd8f6ab2adb86d2ccb05d999e9f8bf4cd16e59","amp;dn":"Dark+Intruder+%281965%29+Leslie+Nielsen+Better+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56dd8f6ab2adb86d2ccb05d999e9f8bf4cd16e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,221,143,106,178,173,184,109,44,203,5,217,153,233,248,191,76,209,110,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
