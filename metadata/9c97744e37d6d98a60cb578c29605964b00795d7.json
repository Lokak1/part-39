Here is what makes iA Writer different:\r\nCharacter: No preferences. It is how it is. It works like it works. Love it or hate it.\r\nSignal vs Noise: Focus mode allows me to think, spell, and write one sentence at a time.\r\nSpeed: Writer works without mouse. Automarkdown formats semantic entities such as headlines, lists, bold, strong, block quotes written in markdown.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in version 3.1:\r\n- Library Locations: Any local folder can be added to the Library\r\n- Dropbox will discontinue the sync iA Writer uses shortly. To continue working with Dropbox files in the Library, add your Dropbox folder as a Library Location\r\n- Share to Medium.com: A new draft will be created and opened in browser each time you share\r\n- Japanese and German localizations\r\n- Improved Syntax Control, with multiple selection and colors\r\n- Added Preferences dialog (âŒ˜,)\r\n- New for Templates:\r\n- Choose indentation or vertical spacing for paragraphs\r\n- Choose centered or left-justified headings\r\n- New windows use the size, position, and Preview size of last resized window\r\n- Default extension uses last extension change\r\n- Removed dashes around page numbers in footer for printed documents and PDF export\r\n- Fixed bugs and improved stability\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c97744e37d6d98a60cb578c29605964b00795d7","amp;dn":"iA+Writer+3.1+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c97744e37d6d98a60cb578c29605964b00795d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,151,116,78,55,214,217,138,96,203,87,140,41,96,89,100,176,7,149,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
