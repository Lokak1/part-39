The album, with its comparatively heavy folk-rock sound married to good lyrics, strives for the realism and capital &quot;I&quot; importance of Paul Simon, or even Phil Ochs, without the blatant politics. Denver tackles two Tom Paxton songs, including &quot;Forest Lawn,&quot; a wry swipe at the cemetery business that echoes Evelyn Waugh&amp;#039;s classic novel The Loved One. Pretty folk isn&amp;#039;t entirely absent -- &quot;Aspenglow&quot; is the cut that is usually included on anthologies. According to the liner notes, Take Me to Tomorrow and Denver&amp;#039;s solo debut, Rhymes &amp; Reasons, combine to replicate his concert performance circa 1969, with Rhymes &amp; Reasons comprising the lighter first-half of the show, and Take Me to Tomorrow the more rousing and cerebral second-half. Viewed from that perspective, the album accomplishes its goal, but it is not a typical John Denver album and is sure to delight fans old and new! Shame that this disc is so rare and hard to find, as so many of his albums are!\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:    John Denver\n? Title:     Take Me To Tomorrow\n? Year:     1970\n?
