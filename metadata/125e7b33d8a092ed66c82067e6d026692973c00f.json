A. Fock.\n\nVladimir Aleksandrovich Fock was one of the group of brilliant\nphysics theoreticians whose work built the magnificent edifice of\nthe quantum theory.\n\nThe author's main purpose is to introduce the reader to a new\nset of ideas differing greatly from the classical theory. He has\nendeavoured to avoid using images from the classical theory as\nbeing inapplicable to quantum physics. Rather, he has attempted\nto familiarize the reader with the basic concepts underlying a\nquantum description of the states of atomic systems.\n\nThe second edition of this book, unlike the first, devotes a separate\nchapter to the nonrelativistic theory of the electron spin (Pauli's\ntheory of the electron) and contains a chapter on the many-electron\nproblem of quantum mechanics. In addition, some of the author's\nfindings have been incorporated as separate sections. Otherwise, the\nsubject matter of the book (both the mathematical theory and its\nphysical interpretation) remains the same, except for certain new\nformulations of an epistemological character (the concepts of\nrelativity with respect to the means of observation and of potential\npossibility), which has necessitated changing the expression &quot;the\nstatistical interpretation of quantum mechanics&quot; to &quot;the probabilistic\ninterpretation&quot;. The new formulations are more precise than the\nprevious ones.\n\nThe title of the book speaks for itself. The word &quot;fundamentals&quot;\ncan be understood as &quot;basic principles&quot; or as &quot;introductory\nfacts&quot;.\n\nThis book was translated from the Russian by Eugene Yankovsky. The\nbook was published by first Mir Publishers in 1978 with a reprint\nin 1982. \n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  PDF | 8.6 MB | Pages: 366 (183x 2 in 1) | OCR \n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nForeword\nPreface to the Second Russian Edition\nPreface to the First Russian Edition\n\nPART I\nBASIC CONCEPTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS\n\nChapter I.
