After a flaw was discovered in the proof, Wiles had to work for another year--he had already labored in solitude for seven years--to establish that he had solved the 350-year-old problem. Simon Singh's book is a lively, comprehensible explanation of Wiles's work and of the star-, trauma-, and wacko-studded history of Fermat's last theorem. Fermat's Enigma contains some problems that offer a taste of the math, but it also includes limericks to give a feeling for the goofy side of mathematicians.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe45804827eb751291fbe2a76ae9bae4cb3da22","amp;dn":"Simon+Singh+-+Fermat%5C%27s+Last+Theorem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe45804827eb751291fbe2a76ae9bae4cb3da22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,228,88,4,130,126,183,81,41,31,190,42,118,174,155,174,76,179,218,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
