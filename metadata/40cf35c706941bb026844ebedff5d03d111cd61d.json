That was Merry Clayton. Her vocal powerhouse helped make the song a classic. However, Merry Clayton wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t meant to even sing on Gimme Shelter. No. She replaced Bonnie Bramlett, who was ill and missed the recording of Gimme Shelter. Merry stepped in and her performance on Gimme Shelter transformed her career.\n\nFollowing the release of Gimme Shelter, Merry Clayton signed to Lou AdlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ode Records. This would be the start of her solo career. Fittingly, MerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album was entitled Gimme Shelter. Produced by Lou Adler, Gimme Shelter featured cover versions of songs written by Paul Simon, James Taylor, Billy Preston, Van Morrison and unsurprisingly, Jagger and Richards. A total of eleven tracks featured on Gimme Shelter, which was released in 1969, when Merry was twenty-two. However, MerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career began when she was just fourteen.\n\nCountry Road (James Taylor)\nTell All The People (The Doors)\nBridge Over Troubled Water (Paul Simon)\t\nI've Got Life \t\nGimme Shelter (The Rolling Stones)\nHere Come Those Heartaches Again (James Cleveland)\t\nForget It I Got It (Gary Wright)\nYou've Been Acting Strange (Billy Preston)\nI Ain't Gonna Worry My Life Away (Billy Preston)\nGood Girls \t\nGlad Tiding (Van Morrison)\n\nDavid T.
