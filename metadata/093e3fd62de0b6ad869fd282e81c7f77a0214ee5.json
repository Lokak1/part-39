Epilogue (5:17)\n\nA stunning masterpiece from Swedish composer Magnus Birgersson who once again takes us by surprise and delivers a wide, lush and electric 10th album. Until we meet the sky has a an intensely cinematic sound; from introspective, wispy and intimate ambient electronica it slowly builds up to a shoegazing spirit engulfing the listener in an ethereal dreamworld. An album of dizzying beauty composed by Solar Fields as a one track story in twelve phases from nightscapes to the sky. Deep and addictive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093e3fd62de0b6ad869fd282e81c7f77a0214ee5","amp;dn":"Solar+Fields+-+Until+We+Meet+the+Sky+%28mp3+V0+split%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093e3fd62de0b6ad869fd282e81c7f77a0214ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,62,63,214,45,224,182,173,134,159,210,130,232,28,127,119,160,33,78,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
