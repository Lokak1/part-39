(aired: 1/1/1967)\n#18: To Catch a Thief (aired: 1/8/1967)\n#19: 20th Century Here We Come (aired: 1/22/1967)\n#20: Shad Rack and Other Tortures (aired: 1/29/1967) (in which the show returns to the 20th century)\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nApproximately halfway through the season [actually much later than that - rKimble], the show's lower-than expected ratings resulted in the producers suddenly retooling the series by having the astronauts repair their space capsule and return to 1967 with the cave family in tow. The remainder of the season was spent with Shadd, Gronk and their family adjusting to life in the 1960s, reacting to the unfamiliar surroundings, setting up home in 20th-century New York City.\n\nWhen the show was re-tooled in mid season, the theme lyrics and visuals were also re-tooled to reflect the change.\n\nTheme Song - Version Two:\n\nIt's about time, it's about space,\nAbout cave-people in the strangest place.\nIt's about time, it's about flight-\nTraveling faster than the speed of light.\nAbout cave-people and the brave crew\nAs through the barrier of time they flew.\n\nPast a Roman Senator,\npast an armored knight,\nPast a fighting minuteman\nto this modern site.\n\nIt's about time for you and me\nTo meet these people from 1,000,000 BC.\n\nIt's about two astronauts and how they educate\nA prehistoric woman and her prehistoric mate.\n\nAnd now... IT'S ABOUT TIME!\n\nEnd theme:\n\nIt's about time, it's about space,\nAbout cave-people in the strangest place.\n\nThey will be here with all of us,\ndodging a taxi, car or bus.\nWhere will they go? What will they do\nIn this strange place where everything is new?\n\nWill they manage to survive?\nWatch each week and see.\nWill they get accustomed to the 20th Century?\n\nIt's about time for our goodbyes\nTo all these prehistoric gals and guys.\n\nIT'S ABOUT TIME!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6862799dbb087edadbc6221e4ca2311d58e60e3","amp;dn":"Its+About+Time+Episodes+17-20+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6862799dbb087edadbc6221e4ca2311d58e60e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,134,39,153,219,176,135,237,173,188,98,33,228,202,35,17,213,142,96,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
