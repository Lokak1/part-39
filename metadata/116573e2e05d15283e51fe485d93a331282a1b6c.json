As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.\n\n\nPlease seed after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:116573e2e05d15283e51fe485d93a331282a1b6c","amp;dn":"The+Wrestler+%282008%29+DVDrip.+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"116573e2e05d15283e51fe485d93a331282a1b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,101,115,226,224,93,21,40,62,81,254,72,93,147,163,49,40,42,27,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
