Most of the book is the usual anthropomorphic talking animal stuff with some decent writing/stories and above average art. I actually enjoyed most of this one. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac5cd555df5905ddfb1f3a3887644a9ce5966eab","amp;dn":"Lion+and+Lamb+Comics+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac5cd555df5905ddfb1f3a3887644a9ce5966eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,92,213,85,223,89,5,221,251,31,58,56,135,100,74,156,229,150,110,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
