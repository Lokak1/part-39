It convinced me more than ever that there was a large body of fans who enjoyed the adventures of Batman and Robin as much as I did.&quot;[1] \n\nThis was I think the first Batman fanzine, but I am not postive on that;\nThis is Super Rare and very very hard to find, as each issue only had at most 1000 copies!  you should see what they go for on Ebay and other comics related auctions! I got as much of the series as I could, but am still missing 2 issues, 17 and 18, if you got them LMK!\n\n\nOtherwise Please seed so others can enjoy due to my limited bandwidth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afddd5ba2bbab808c9f8a78d270e9a47bc892df3","amp;dn":"Batmania%21+Batman+fanzine+SUPER+RARE%21+1964-1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afddd5ba2bbab808c9f8a78d270e9a47bc892df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,221,213,186,43,186,184,8,201,248,167,141,39,14,154,71,188,137,45,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
