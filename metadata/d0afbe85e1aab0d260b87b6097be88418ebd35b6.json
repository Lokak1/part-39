This volume concentrates on watercolors and drawings from roughly that period, showing a Kokoschka influenced most notably by Gustav Klimt but not without similarities to the younger Egon Schiele. By the teens, Kokoschka was developing his own expressionist style, which emerged full-blown and florid in the '20s. Editor Sabarsky, a dealer and authority on German expressionism, contributes a rather lumpish introductory essay, accompanied by an obfuscatory verbal outing by Italian vanguard critic Oliva. But Kokoschka's early art more than compensates for the texts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0afbe85e1aab0d260b87b6097be88418ebd35b6","amp;dn":"Oskar+Kokoschka-Drawings+and+Watercolors-Early+Years+1906-1924","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0afbe85e1aab0d260b87b6097be88418ebd35b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,175,190,133,225,170,176,210,96,184,123,96,151,190,136,65,142,189,53,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
