We will go through the pixel specific terms such as anti-aliasing, dithering, pillow shading, and outlining, to help better understand pixel art. From there we will take a quick look at color and how to use techniques such as hue shifting to give your work a boost in value and saturation on such a small scale. For each of the objects we will be creating (rock, tree, character) I will take a classic and modern approach to show different ways of going about the many different styles of pixel art.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cgcnetworksites.cgcookie.netdna-cdn.com/concept/files/2012/12/pixel_01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cgcnetworksites.cgcookie.netdna-cdn.com/concept/files/2012/12/pixel_01.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe resources included in this course\n\nThe resources are in the downloadable source files and contain the following: The pixel art brushes that are used throughout the course, a custom font for quick pixel writing, a chart explaining each of the pixel art terms, a collection guide giving a step by step look at how to create the rock, tree, and character, the pixel .PSD containing every pixel creation that was made during the course along with examples for you to look at, and finally a Pixel Character Base, which you can take and create your own character to post in the gallery below!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cgcnetworksites.cgcookie.netdna-cdn.com/concept/files/2012/12/pixel_02.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cgcnetworksites.cgcookie.netdna-cdn.com/concept/files/2012/12/pixel_02.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTable of Content:\n14 Lessons\n 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Introduction\n 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Getting Started\n 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Anti-Aliasing\n 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dithering\n 5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pillow Shading\n 6 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Outlining\n 7 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Color\n 8 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Classic\n 9 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Modern\n 10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tree Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Classic\n 11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tree Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Modern\n 12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Character Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Classic\n 13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Character Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Modern\n 14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Outro","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c91af81d96f82f6a32bd1ba967acab3a3e8273d8","amp;dn":"The+Pixel+Course+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c91af81d96f82f6a32bd1ba967acab3a3e8273d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,26,248,29,150,248,47,106,50,189,27,169,103,172,171,58,62,130,115,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
