The movie is over 2 hours in length and that is why the file is a little large in order to keep the quality good.  And please continue to seed after you receive the complete file.\n\nAfter the American Civil War, a rebel soldier and his wife become pioneer farmers in Florida. Their son Jody is 11 years old; he gets along well with his warm and affectionate pa, but his ma is haunted by the death of her other children, so she&amp;#039;s somber, even cold. The boy wants a pet: the dad is sympathetic, the mom obdurate. When a rattler bites pa, pa kills a doe to use its organs to draw out the poison. Jody begs to keep the doe&amp;#039;s fawn as a pet. The parents agree, and the boy and the deer are soon inseparable. The fawn grows quickly, and as a yearling tramples tobacco shoots and eats the newly-sprouted corn. This is too much for ma, and Jody has to face harsh, adult realities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b53920b3b2c76c087fb0f0acc3785c1fae85bc5","amp;dn":"THE_YEARLING","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b53920b3b2c76c087fb0f0acc3785c1fae85bc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,83,146,11,59,44,118,192,135,251,15,10,204,55,133,193,250,232,91,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
