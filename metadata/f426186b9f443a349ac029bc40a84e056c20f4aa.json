The site, however, appears abandoned and soon, they are imprisoned by a sinister Chroner boy named Isaac (John Franklin). The boy mysteriously controls all children in the region. Isaac managed to convince them to murder every adult to a bloody ritual. Indeed, the sacrifices are necessary, because the blood is used to fertilize a sacred crop.
