The still juvenile Dr. Spencer Reid is an erudite on everything except real life, Penelope Garcia a brilliant computer whiz who gets access to any database etc. As they are mobile, cooperation with local police and FBI agents is important but often poses jurisdictional and other problems, as do some witnesses and suspects.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5545c2fe3a94b2be645dab3972ff4899a907a490","amp;dn":"Criminal.Minds.S08E18.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5545c2fe3a94b2be645dab3972ff4899a907a490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,69,194,254,58,148,178,190,100,93,171,57,114,255,72,153,169,7,164,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
