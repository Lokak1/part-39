She dares to be different, speaking truth, not bs rhetoric. Her style is intergalactic, flow is other-worldy. She has traveled extensively, collecting these experiences as inspiration for her music. From subject matter ranging from melanin to pyramids, Saroc spits metaphysical ideas over melodic hip hop beats, seeking to fuse knowledge of self with great music. She is undoubtedly and unapologetically a REAL MC.\n\nTrack list:\n1. War of the Gods Featuring Afrika Bambaataa 03:08\n2. The Moors of Alhambra 02:29\n3. Sun Tzu 03:22\t\n4.
