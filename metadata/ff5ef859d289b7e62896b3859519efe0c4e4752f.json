Again, McLaughlin sounds rejuvenated and refreshed in this format, as he switches between acoustic guitar and a guitar synthesizer attachment that softens and rounds his attacks while creating some luminous timbres and textures.  McLaughlin's on-again, off-again Indian kick rises prominently into view here as Trilok Gurtu's role broadens into that of an all-purpose percussionist, producing some amazing sounds as backdrops.  Pastorius-influenced bassist Kai Eckhardt gets downright funky on &quot;1 Nite Stand&quot; but gives way to the equally accomplished Dominque Di Piazza on most tracks.  Yes, there is even some fantastic straight-ahead blues grooving on &quot;Hijacked&quot; -- if one may be permitted to use the terms guitar synthesizer and straight-ahead in the same sentence. ~ Richard S.
