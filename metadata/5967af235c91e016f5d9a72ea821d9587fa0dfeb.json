No less astonishing is the span in date of manufacture, ranging over five thousand years from the fourth millennium b.c. to the early second millennium a.d.

On the whole, the pieces are of remarkably small scale. The compact size of the objects from Iran and Central Asia clearly reflects the dictates imposed by a mobile nomadic or semi-nomadic society whose possessionspersonal ornaments, figurines, weapons, pole tops-had to be portable.
