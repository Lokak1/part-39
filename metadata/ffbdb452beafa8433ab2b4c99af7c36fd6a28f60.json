A disgruntled retired politician complains to his daughter that he hears the sound of digging at night. Could it be their tenant, that young Arab? But then the young Arab hears the digging sounds too. Where has the mayorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife gone, vanished without trace, her note saying &quot;DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry about me&quot;?\n\nAround the village, the veneer of new wealth -- gourmet restaurants, art galleries, a winery -- barely conceals the scars of war and of past generations: disused air raid shelters, rusting farm tools, and trucks left wherever they stopped. Scenes from Village Life is a memorable novel-in-stories by the acclaimed Israeli author Amos Oz: a brilliant, unsettling glimpse of what goes on beneath the surface of everyday life.\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Scenes from Village Life is like a symphony, its movements more impressive together than in isolation. There is, in each story, a particular chord or strain; but taken together, these chords rise and reverberate, evoking an unease so strong itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost a taste in the mouth... Scenes from Village Life is a brief collection, but its brevity is a testament to its force. You will not soon forget it.&quot; -- New York Times Book Review\n\n&quot;Finely wrought... Oz writes characterizations that are subtle but surgically precise, rendering this work a powerfully understated treatment of an uneasy Israeli conscience.&quot; -- Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;Informed by everything, weighed down by nothing, this is an exquisite work of art.&quot; -- The Scotsman\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffbdb452beafa8433ab2b4c99af7c36fd6a28f60","amp;dn":"Amos+Oz+-+Scenes+from+Village+Life+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffbdb452beafa8433ab2b4c99af7c36fd6a28f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,189,180,82,190,175,168,67,58,178,180,201,154,247,195,111,214,162,143,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
