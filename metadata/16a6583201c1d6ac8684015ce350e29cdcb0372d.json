When an accident gives him the opportunity to return to the ring, do not let it escape. Your opponent is younger and faster, but with the support of his old team (Michael Ironside and James Caan) works hard for this his last fight. Not knowing when to throw in the towel, Sailor has to face his personal demons or die trying to keep himself standing over a brutal and bloody fight in the ring.
