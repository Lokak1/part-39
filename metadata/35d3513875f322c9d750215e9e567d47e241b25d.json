Step-by-step instructions for 24 projects, eight of which are specifically designed for beginning weavers, are offered within the special lay-flat binding and describe the entire projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from weaving the base and upsetting the sides to applying a handle and finishing with a rim. Patterns are supplied for unique creations such as an Abenaki-style knitting basket, a fabric melon basket, a natural-vine wall basket, and a braided, twill tote. A special photo insert contains images of baskets from all over the world, making this a beautiful book to both use and display.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35d3513875f322c9d750215e9e567d47e241b25d","amp;dn":"A+Basketmaker%5C%27s+Odyssey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35d3513875f322c9d750215e9e567d47e241b25d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,211,81,56,117,243,34,201,215,80,33,94,158,86,125,71,226,65,178,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
