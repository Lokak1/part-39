Sawyer, the author of such Ã¢â‚¬Å“revelatory and thought-provokingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½* novels as Triggers and The WWW Trilogy, presents a noir mystery expanded from his Hugo and Nebula Award-nominated novella Ã¢â‚¬Å“Identity TheftÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his Aurora Award-winning short story Ã¢â‚¬Å“Biding Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and set on a lawless Mars in a future where everything is cheap, and life is even cheaperÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAlex Lomax is the one and only private eye working the mean streets of New Klondike, the Martian frontier town that sprang up forty years ago after Simon Weingarten and Denny OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly discovered fossils on the Red Planet. Back on Earth, where anything can be synthesized, the remains of alien life are the most valuable of all collectibles, so shiploads of desperate treasure hunters stampeded to Mars in the Great Martian Fossil Rush.\n\nTrying to make an honest buck in a dishonest world, Lomax tracks down killers and kidnappers among the failed prospectors, corrupt cops, and a growing population of transfersÃ¢â‚¬â€lucky stiffs who, after striking paleontological gold, upload their minds into immortal android bodies. But when he uncovers clues to solving the decades-old murders of Weingarten and OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly, along with a journal that may lead to their legendary mother lode of Martian fossils, God only knows what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll dig up...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e42dcea4756e14842d852ab706927c289921ab","amp;dn":"Red+Planet+Blues+-+Robert+J+Sawyer+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e42dcea4756e14842d852ab706927c289921ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,228,45,206,164,117,110,20,132,45,133,42,183,6,146,124,40,153,33,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
