That the myths contained a considerable element of fiction was recognized by the more critical Greeks, such as the philosopher Plato in the 5thÃ¢â‚¬â€œ4th centuries BCE. In general, however, in the popular piety of the Greeks, the myths were viewed as true accounts. Greek mythology has subsequently had extensive influence on the arts and literature of Western civilization, which fell heir to much of Greek culture.\n\nAlthough people of all countries, eras, and stages of civilization have developed myths that explain the existence and workings of natural phenomena, recount the deeds of gods or heroes, or seek to justify social or political institutions, the myths of the Greeks have remained unrivaled in the Western world as sources of imaginative and appealing ideas. Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in Classical mythological themes.\n\n\n\nBy Britannica Educational Publishing, Michael Taft\nPublished by Britannica in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 96 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f023948706e7d95c83e3417554ae9ba21267bd","amp;dn":"Greek+Gods+%26amp%3B+Goddesses+%281st+Ed%29+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f023948706e7d95c83e3417554ae9ba21267bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,240,35,148,135,6,231,217,92,131,227,65,117,84,174,155,162,18,103,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
