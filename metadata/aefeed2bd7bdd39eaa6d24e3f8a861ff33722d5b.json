Stop and Listen Blues (Eleanor Ellis) [2:42]\n\nAside from her duties as lead singer and guitar player for Lovewhip she plays authentic rootsy acoustic blues from the 1930's, finger-picking intricate guitar parts while singing. In a genre that is often dominated by males, Erin is breaking new ground as a very accomplished female guitar player with a soulful voice and feel for the blues.\n\nPlaying acoustic delta blues in the vein of Memphis Minnie and early Bonnie Raitt, Erin simply plays guitar and sings the blues like no other. Erin began playing the guitar in her late teens, taught by her father, Neil Harpe. They soon began performing together at Folk Festivals, coffee houses, bars, and parties in the Washington DC area, doing various styles of blues that her father played when she was growing up.\n\nNow based in Boston, Erin has continued to develop a strong blues guitar and vocal style of her own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aefeed2bd7bdd39eaa6d24e3f8a861ff33722d5b","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Erin+Harpe+-+Blues+Roots","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aefeed2bd7bdd39eaa6d24e3f8a861ff33722d5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,254,237,43,215,189,211,158,170,109,36,227,248,168,97,255,51,114,45,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
