Jay O. Sanders is simply superb. All characters (even Woofer, a dog who \nplays an important role) are fully voiced. One of the characterizations, the golem\nis so strikingly different from Sanders&amp;#039;s &quot;normal&quot; voice that it&amp;#039;s difficult at first \nto recognize that it&amp;#039;s still Sanders speaking.\n\n---------------------------------\nRelease Date....October 1, 1993\n---------------------------------\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!
