A series of encounters between the two groups quickly escalates into all out war. For all the book's humorous and charming appearance, beneath this entertaining veneer runs a stirring examination of the dual nature of existence, the dichotomy within the human mind, and our profound effect on the ecological environment. A modern day fable for adults and kids alike based on the age-old struggle between nature and technology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa22a2d7db53e1cbacbfac166746ee5fb371c3c0","amp;dn":"James+Kochalka+-+Monkey+vs+Robot+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa22a2d7db53e1cbacbfac166746ee5fb371c3c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,34,162,215,219,83,225,203,172,191,172,22,103,70,238,95,179,113,195,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
