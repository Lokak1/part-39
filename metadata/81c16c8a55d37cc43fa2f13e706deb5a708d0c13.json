This package includes set of decisions to provide you a new (not realized before) winter features, such as the iced lakes and rivers, roofs under the snow etc. Seas and oceans could be iced near the coastline as well. Your winter in FS becomes more and more realistic! \nNew Management utility now allows you to control both NW products (includes Trees 2.0) if it is installed.\n\nNote! \nThis product has some restrictions due to MSFS own technology. NW Winter is designed for local flights over iced and snowed terrain during winter season. It is recommended to restore initial textures when you going to fly at other seasons or in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnon-winterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ territories. \nTextures just make the water ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlook-likeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ iced. It is not true, that you can land on such ice! \nFor proper work with these textures you should turn off ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwavesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in your Simulator water settings (set water details as low). It can be done automatically when product installs.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nhxxp://secure.simmarket.com/samoshin-natural-world-winter.phtml","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c16c8a55d37cc43fa2f13e706deb5a708d0c13","amp;dn":"FSX+-+FS9+-+Samoshin+Natural+World+Winter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c16c8a55d37cc43fa2f13e706deb5a708d0c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,193,108,138,85,211,124,196,63,162,241,62,112,109,235,90,112,141,12,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
