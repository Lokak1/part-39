I have been collecting Films for years and now I want to share. Enjoy and don,t forget to SEED. SEED SEED. Thank you.\n\nHue and Cry (1947) is a British film directed by Charles Crichton and starring Alastair Sim, Harry Fowler and Joan Dowling.\n\nIt is generally considered to be the first of the &quot;Ealing comedies&quot;, although it is better characterised as a thriller for children. Shot almost entirely on location, it is now a notable historic document due to its vivid portrait of a London still showing the damage of World War II. London forms the backdrop of a crime-gangster plot which revolves around a working-class children's street culture and children's secret clubs.\n\n\nI was a youngster in London during the Blitz.  The scenes are very realistic and true.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ecbd74a03d6ecc422cf7709c8280d3c15726a3d","amp;dn":"Hue+and+Cry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ecbd74a03d6ecc422cf7709c8280d3c15726a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,203,215,74,3,214,236,196,34,207,119,9,200,40,13,60,21,114,106,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
