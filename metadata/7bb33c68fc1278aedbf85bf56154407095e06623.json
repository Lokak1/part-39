In T. Rex and the Crater of Doom, some brilliant, not to mention determined, scientists roam the world and seek out the clues. What they conclude is that the earth withstood a colossal impact with a meteor (or perhaps a comet) 65 million years ago. The resulting cataclysm destroyed half the life on the planet.\nWalter Alvarez, a geologist at the University of California at Berkeley, and one of the four scientists who present this theory on the mystery, tells the story in a clear narrative that contains a wealth of scientific material. The book does require an investment of attention, but the presentation is quite readable, and the story itself is fascinating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bb33c68fc1278aedbf85bf56154407095e06623","amp;dn":"T-Rex+and+the+Crater+of+Doom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bb33c68fc1278aedbf85bf56154407095e06623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,179,60,104,252,18,120,174,219,248,91,245,97,84,64,112,149,224,102,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
