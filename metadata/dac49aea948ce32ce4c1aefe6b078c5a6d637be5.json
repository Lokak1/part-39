The nine numbers (all but one from 1954-1956) are easily available elsewhere and, although the music (which features such sidemen as altoist Jackie McLean, tenors John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, and Lucky Thompson, trombonist J.J. Johnson, and pianists Red Garland and Horace Silver, among others) is sometimes classic, there are better ways to acquire it.
