Payment and census records, contracts and necrologies from the period refer to three Castello instrumentalists who were almost certainly related: Bartolomeo, Giovanni Francesco and Giovanni Battista. The last of these was engaged as a member of the Dogeâ€™s six-strong team of piffari, or wind players, from 27 December 1624 to 15 November 1633, noted in the San Marco archives as son of â€˜Dario of Venice, musician in our aforementioned chapelâ€™.\r\n\r\n&quot;Other biographical references to Dario Castello appear only in the title-pages and dedications of the composerâ€™s two volumes of â€˜Sonate concertateâ€™, published in Venice respectively in 1621 and 1629. Several editions of Castelloâ€™s popular yet technically demanding and musically adventurous sonata anthologies were made, with Book I reprinted in Venice and Antwerp as late as 1658. Two editions of Book I describe the composer as â€˜Capo di Compagnia de Musichi dâ€™Instrumenti da fiato in Venetiaâ€™, leader of a Venetian company of piffari, while the Book II dedications announce that he was also a musician at San Marco. Eleanor Selfridge-Fieldâ€™s painstaking archival detective work in the 1960s and early 1970s discovered no mention of a Dario Castello, musician or otherwise, resident in Venice between 1621 and 1658. Her attempts to reconstruct a â€˜non-existentâ€™ biography include the suggestion that the composerâ€™s sonata volumes were published under an anagram of his real name, although there appears to be no suitable candidate to satisfy the efforts even of determined problem-solvers.
