Its music is heavily influenced by David Bowie, Queen, and T.Rex. The band's best known single is &quot;In the Meantime&quot;.\n\nThough all the band members are from Leeds, West Yorkshire, the band was formed in New York City in 1994 when Antony Langdon met Cragg by chance in a cafÃƒÂ© where Cragg had a job killing rats. Soon after, Langdon's brother Royston joined the band, and Spacehog was born. When the band's original guitarist left, Cragg called his friend Richard Steel to join. The band signed in 1994 with Seymour Stein to Sire Records.\n\nOn 24 October 1995, Spacehog released its first album, Resident Alien. It went gold on the Billboard charts, selling over 500,000 copies and spawned the hit single and video &quot;In the Meantime&quot; as well as the single &quot;Cruel To Be Kind&quot;. &quot;In the Meantime&quot; received heavy video and radio play, and was used as background music to BBC's Match of the Day football programme. The band performed the song on Channel 4's TFI Friday in 1996. The band's second album, The Chinese Album, was released on 10 March 1998. Though it did not sell as well as Resident Alien, the band's popularity continued to increase as Spacehog opened for more popular acts like Pearl Jam and Supergrass. The Chinese Album had a more &quot;artsy&quot; sound, with the Pink Floyd-like piano on the opening track and Michael Stipe of R.E.M. contributing vocals to the song &quot;Almond Kisses&quot;.\n\nAfter the band was dropped by Elektra Records, Spacehog signed with the upstart label Artemis Records and released its third album, The Hogyssey, on 10 April 2001. The album continued the band's neo-glam approach and included the singles &quot;I Want to Live&quot; and &quot;At Least I Got Laid&quot;, as well as a funk version of Richard Strauss's &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;. The band joined The Black Crowes and Oasis on the Tour of Brotherly Love in support of the album, which proved to be the band's final major tour.\n\nRoyston Langdon and American actress Liv Tyler became engaged in February 2001,[8] and married in Barbados on March 25, 2003.[9] In December 2004, she gave birth to their son, Milo William Langdon.[10] On May 8, 2008, the couple confirmed through representatives that they would be separating but remain friends. \n\n\n\n\nResident Alien 1995\n\nResident Alien is the first album by the British glam rock band Spacehog. Released by Elektra Records on 24 October 1995, the album was certified gold on 29 July 1996 and included the hit single &quot;In the Meantime&quot;, which reached the top of the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US, and remained there for four weeks. Most of Resident Alien's basic tracks were recorded live in a barn in Woodstock, New York. It was intended to give the album the immediacy of live room recording.\n\nAlthough Jonny Cragg makes his singing debut in &quot;Skylark&quot; on The Chinese Album, it is his voice that introduces &quot;Space Is the Place&quot; on Resident Alien. The spoken line in the middle of &quot;Never Coming Down (Part II)&quot;, &quot;Everybody in the world is bent&quot;, comes from the 1969 movie The Italian Job. The movie also features jail inmates clapping out the rhythm used in this song. A tribute to the film Candyman, the chorus to &quot;Candyman&quot; repeats the titular name four times (also referencing the Sammy Davis Jr. standard).\n\n&quot;Only a Few&quot; and &quot;In the Meantime&quot; were used in the 1996 movie Libor Karas World Tour, The Bouncing Czech. &quot;In the Meantime&quot; was also used as the theme song for David Spade's 1998 one-hour HBO stand-up comedy special David Spade: Take the Hit, was used in the film Fanboys and is a playable song in the video game Guitar Hero 5 as a re-recording, as the original recording featured in Rock Band 3.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;In the Meantime&quot; - 4:58\n2.\t&quot;Spacehog&quot; (Antony Langdon) - 2:13\n3.\t&quot;Starside&quot; - 3:49\n4.\t&quot;Candyman&quot; - 5:23\n5.\t&quot;Space Is the Place&quot; (A.
