Denis Leary is a comedy genius. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78f3d8871af6a744abbbffe5adec2876299fa1cd","amp;dn":"DENNIS+LEARY+1997+LOCK+AND+LOAD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78f3d8871af6a744abbbffe5adec2876299fa1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,243,216,135,26,246,167,68,171,187,255,229,173,236,40,118,41,159,161,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
