Volume 1, Fluid Mechanics, summarizes the key experiments that show how polymeric fluids differ from structurally simple fluids, then presents, in rough historical order, various methods for solving polymer fluid dynamics problems. Volume 2, Kinetic Theory, uses molecular models and the methods of statistical mechanics to obtain relations between bulk flow behavior and polymer structure. Includes end-of-chapter problems and extensive appendixes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ac6d38c39ce78c5f4c9b848b099c851435cacf","amp;dn":"Dynamics+of+Polymeric+Liquids+2nd+ed+%5BVol.+1%26amp%3B2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ac6d38c39ce78c5f4c9b848b099c851435cacf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,172,109,56,195,156,231,140,95,76,155,132,139,9,156,133,20,53,202,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
