The British conquered the desert, the Germans succumbed to MoscowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s winter, and the Japanese awakened the sleeping giant of American might. In just three weeks, from November 17 to December 8, the course of World War II was decided and the fate of Germany and Japan was sealed.\n\nWith new insight and a fresh perspective, David Downing tells the story of these crucial days, shifting the riveting narrative from snowbound Russian villages to the stormy northern Pacific, from the North African desert to EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s warring capitals, and from Tokyo to Washington.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 400 pages\n# Publisher: Da Capo Press (May 25, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0306816202","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46747cfaf5469b3973d47d4a1c7839fa4b9dadbc","amp;dn":"Sealing+Their+Fate+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46747cfaf5469b3973d47d4a1c7839fa4b9dadbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,116,124,250,245,70,155,57,115,212,125,74,28,120,57,250,75,157,173,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
