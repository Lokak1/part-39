Conway (Original Mix)6:02\n\n\n\n&quot;In recent years, the New Zealander (now living in London) has found a home on the long-running Dispatch Recordings label, which has released a handful of his collaborative and split EPs. With Under Another Sky, he's set to make a proper splash on the labelÃ¢â‚¬â€the 15-track album will not only see release in full on digital format, it'll also be preceded by a sampler EP (out this week) and two more vinyl releases featuring selections from the digital version and exclusive tunes. The LP has Cern exploring the full breadth of his sound, with a smattering of drum &amp; bass tempo tracks as well as forays into other genres as well. Loxy, DLR, Hydro and Overlook all feature.\n\n\n(Album Sampler):\n\n&quot;Setting the wheels in motion for his forthcoming Ã¢â‚¬Å“Under Another Sky LPÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Cern opens his 2nd studio album with three teaser tracks to wet your beak. An artist who never shies from experimentation, whilst consistently striking a chord deep down, Cern offers a sample of the damage, reflection and reconstruction that lies ahead.\n\nStarting things off with a track exclusively available for this album sampler, Ã¢â‚¬Å“TiamatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ loosens the reigns and unleashes a storm that matures below the surface, retaining composure and clout all the while. Named after an ancient goddess that embodied primordial chaos, Cern engineers a perfect set opener with precision; low ends striking right at the chest.\n\nAs the dust clears in the aftermath of bedlam, the tempo relaxes somewhat as we are welcomed by Ã¢â‚¬Å“What We Bring Upon OurselvesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The orchestral introduction is profound, yet cautious and thought-provoking. Delicate strings and serene chords evoke a warm glow, enveloping vinyl crackles in a truly sublime musical interlude.\n\nThis leads smoothly into the superbly layered Ã¢â‚¬Å“ConwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which picks the pace back up, but teasing, in playful, almost tormenting fashion. Initially subtle and ultra-stripped, it quickly gathers momentum with menacing drive. Breathtaking amen flashes emerge sporadically, before retreating to minimal flickers; masterfully controlling the dance.
