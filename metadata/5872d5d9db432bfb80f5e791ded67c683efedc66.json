Sets were supplied in two, three and four car sets, depending on the service they were intended for, and passenger accommodation was provided in first and standard class configuration.\n\nWith more than 500 units built, the Class 101 could be seen on routes across the country and saw service many years into the privatisation of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s railways. The final five units survived 47 years of service, finally being withdrawn on 24 December 2003, but thanks to their longevity many units have been preserved on the countrys heritage railways.\n\nRe-skinned and upgraded from an earlier Class 101 pack, the Class 101 for Train Simulator 2013 is available in Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) black and orange livery, the first such time the distinctive livery has appeared on any Train Simulator model. Features include manual gear change control, fully detailed cab and control panel, in-cab lighting and an upgrade to TSX standard features. Also included are a number of exciting scenarios for the West Coast Main Line.\n\nThe West Coast Main Line Add-On &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7820676/Train_Simulator_2013_-_West_Coast_Main_Line_North&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7820676/Train_Simulator_2013_-_West_Coast_Main_Line_North&lt;/a&gt;\n(available) is required to play the scenarios included with this Add-On.\n\nScenarios\nThree scenarios for the West Coast Main Line route:\n\nGearing Up\nSlip and Slide\nStrathclyde Showers\n\nKey Features\nClass 101 in Strathclyde Passenger Transport orange and black livery\nDMCL, DMBS, DMSL, TCL, TSL and TBSL rail vehicles\nManual gear change control\nFully detailed cab and control panel including instrument backlighting\nUpgraded TSX effects\nScenarios for the West Coast Main Line\nQuick Drive compatible\n\nHow to Install:\n\nTrain Simulator 2013 (Will only work with a cracked edition)\nIn the game folder (&quot;...
