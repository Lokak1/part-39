Although rated as DVD-5 quality, this in fact seems to have been sourced from VHS tape. So although the ripped content is less than a quarter the size of the original (the entire series now fitting snugly on a single DVD!), I think the degradation in video quality is hardly noticeable.\n\nThis rip includes both the Russian &amp; English soundtracks, as well as the English subtitles. I have even included the 2 DVD-menu soundtracks (which I think are excellent) for completeness.\n\nIf you value this excellent series then \n\n*** PLEASE SEED ***\n*** PLEASE SEED ***\n*** PLEASE SEED ***\n\n\n\n&quot;History knows no greater display of courage than \nthat shown by the people of Soviet Russia ...&quot;\n\n                              Henry L.
