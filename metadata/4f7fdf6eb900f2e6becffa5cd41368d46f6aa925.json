The child is given three digits and two operators and has to compose the case him/herself.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so special about it? The child visually memorizes the case itself and can see what will happen if he changes the digits. Now there is no need to scissor out paper digits. The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TrainingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. \n\nAfter solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\n\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to study with him. After the solving you will always be able to see the way he or she has solved it.\n\nToday there is no app with similar functionality.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=math.magicpaint&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=math.magicpaint&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f7fdf6eb900f2e6becffa5cd41368d46f6aa925","amp;dn":"Magic+Paint+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f7fdf6eb900f2e6becffa5cd41368d46f6aa925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,127,223,110,185,0,242,230,190,207,250,92,212,19,104,212,111,106,169,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
