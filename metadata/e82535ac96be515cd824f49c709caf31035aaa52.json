Thus we are complete. We are more than complete today by including  a couple Vertigo titles that are versions (perversions?) of DC titles and some misc extras, the most significant being The Complete Underworld Unleashed Archives v1-5, which contains the other stories needed to complete the Underworld Unleashed story.\nSome titles are split by name changes. The rest will appear in due course. I follow the Phantom in this. Some comics indica do not have the volume numbers I use. The word of the Stranger is taken without question in such matters.\n\nToday's offering:\nWeird Worlds\nWeird Western Tales v2 (Vertigo included because of v1)\nWeird Western Tales v1 (after All Star Western 11\nWeird War Tales v2 Special.cbr  (Vertigo included because of v1)\nWeird War Tales v2 (Vertigo included because of v1)\nWeird War Tales v1\nWeird Secret Origins ctc (2004).cbr\nWeird Mystery Tales v2 (1996).cbr\nWeird Mystery Tales v1 (1972-1975)\nWeird (1988)\nWatchmen (TPB) (Excluded).jpg\nWatchmen (HC) (Excluded).jpg\nWatchmen\nWasteland v1\nWarlord-Savage Empire TPB (Omitted).jpg\nWarlord v3\nWarlord v2 (1992)\nWarlord v1 Annual (1982-1987)\nWarlord v1 (1976-1988)\nWar of the Gods (1991)\nWar That Time Forgot (2008)\nWanted (Wanted the World's Most Dangerous Villains)\nWanderers (1988)\nVixen-Return of The Lion (2009)(two issues still to be published)\nViper (Covers Only-Unscanned)\nVillains United TPB (Omitted).jpg\nVillains United Infinite Crisis Special.cbr\nVillains United\nViking Glory-The Viking Prince TPB.cbr\nViking Glory-The Viking Prince HC (Omittted).jpg\nVigilante-City Lights, Prairie Justice\nVigilante v3 001 (2009).cbr\nVigilante v2 (2005)\nVigilante v1 Annual\nVigilante v1\nVext\nV for Vendetta\nV for Vendetta TPB (Omitted).jpg\nV for Vendetta HC (Omitted).jpg\nV\nUntold Legend of The Batman (1980)\nUnlimited Access (DC-Marvel(1998)\nUnknown Soldier v4  (Vertigo included because of v1&amp;2)\nUnknown Soldier v3  (Vertigo included because of v1&amp;2)\nUnknown Soldier v2\nUnknown Soldier v1 205-268 (after Star Spangled War Stories 204\nUnknown Soldier TPB (Omitted).jpg\nUnexpected (after Tales of the Unexpected 104)\nUnderworld Unleashed-Patterns of Fear (1995).cbr\nUnderworld Unleashed TPB (Omitted).jpg\nUnderworld Unleashed Devil's Asylum (1995).cbr\nUnderworld Unleashed Dark Uprising Apokolips 001 (1995).cbr\nUnderworld Unleashed Abyss-Hell's Sentinel.cbr\nUnderworld Unleashed (1995)\nUnderworld\nUnderstanding Comics (Scott McCloud).cbr\nUncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters TPB (Omitted).jpg\nUncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters v2\nUncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters v1\nUncle Sam (Vertigo included because it's a DC Character\nUncanny X-Men and New Teen Titans in Apokolips...Now (1982).cbr\n\nBonus\nWatchmen annotations (html).zip (Unzip and read with a web browser)\nWarlord Related\n\tWarlord Web Archives.zip (Unzip and read with a web browser)\n\tWarlord Toys by Remco (from CatSpawnDynamics Website).cbr\n\tWarlord Artwork Extras.cbr\n\tWarlord Art (from CatSpawnDynamics Website).cbr\nVigilante v1 Chronology.txt\nV for Vendetta Extras\n\tWelcome to the V For Vendetta Shrine!.mht (requires MS Word)\n\tV For Vendetta Gallery.mht  (requires MS Word)\n\tV For Vendetta Annotations-Page References are from the TPB.rtf\n\tV for Vendetta Ad.jpg\n\tBlather the Alan Moore Interview V For Vendetta.mht (requires MS Word)\nThe Complete Underworld Unleashed Archives v1-5 (DCP Archive Editions) This contains all the related stories in the crossover event\n\nFeel free to cross post this other places if you know how and are so inclined\n\n13\n\nYou can see my other torrents  at\ndemonoid\n\ndemonoid DOT com  and tack on  /files/?uid=1213225&amp;seeded=2\n\nor\n\nh33t\n\nh33t DOT com     and tack on  /userdetails.php?id=72866 \n\n\nthe oddness of the urls above is to by-bass TPB censor bot.\n\nThe lists should be (but aren't) the same.
