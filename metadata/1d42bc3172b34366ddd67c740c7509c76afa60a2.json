So I selected a lot of tracks I would be happy to play for my customers (Bar) and created some playlists I share with you through the Dutch Treat series.\n \nAlong the way it became clear that the moment coincidented with a new movement that hides an important change in our world; Indie. Today all we need is a PC and Microphone. This will bring a lot of changes. So I took it kind of personal to introduce this new movement, with its familiar roots (music from home), as good as possible. So the Indie lists were added.\n \nOnce in a while we need to pause. So I froze my lists, created before the first of July and reorganized them to improve accessibility (and play sequence in cars). Cleaned my 200 old torrents (could still be running elsewhere) and created six torrents to cover the Dutch Treat playlists until 01-07-2012.\n \nA 001-050 (Various artists in various genres part 1)\nA 051-100 (Various artists in various genres part 2)\nB 001-030 (Artists highlighted)\nC 001-035 (Sweetlists various moods)\nI 001-055 (Indie Part 1)\nI 001-055 (Indie Part 2)\n \nYou may need some patience but when we share we will share a lot of beauty to enjoy (and get some new ideas from).... Enjoy. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d42bc3172b34366ddd67c740c7509c76afa60a2","amp;dn":"Dutch+Treat+B+001-030+%28Artists+Highlighted+Until+01-07-2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d42bc3172b34366ddd67c740c7509c76afa60a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,66,188,49,114,179,67,102,221,214,124,116,12,117,9,199,106,250,96,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
