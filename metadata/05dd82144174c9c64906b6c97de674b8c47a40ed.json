These tests are primarily used on-site, i.e. the place where the samples are located instead of in the laboratory. Also, owing to the ever-increasing number of samples to be analysed, preliminary screening and selection of samples is becoming a necessity even in the laboratory The tests described in this book can also be used for this purpose. This book provides the general characteristic features of test methods and systems (e.g. definitions, advantages and limitations, procedures and protocols) and discusses the application of the test methods in various areas. Tools pertinent for solving each concrete analytical task are also discussed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05dd82144174c9c64906b6c97de674b8c47a40ed","amp;dn":"Chemical+Test+Methods+of+Analysis+-+Y.+Zolotov-WaRlOrD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05dd82144174c9c64906b6c97de674b8c47a40ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,221,130,20,65,116,201,198,73,6,182,201,125,230,116,184,196,122,64,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
