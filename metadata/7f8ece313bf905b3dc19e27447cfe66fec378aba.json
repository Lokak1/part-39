The band gained their first contract by winning music magazine Metal Hammer 's newcomer competition in Ludwigsburg one year after forming. In 1994, Andi Deris left the band to join German power metal band Helloween. He was replaced by British singer David Readman.\n\nThe band, often referred to as The Pinkies, became a five-piece in 2003, when Uwe Reitenauer was hired to support guitar player Alfred Koffler, who suffered from neuropathy.\n\nOn 5 March 2012 it was announced that drummer Kosta Zafiriou had left the band, due to his various activities as a manager at the company Bottom Row and as the drummer and manager of the new band Unisonic, which also features Dennis Ward. He was replaced by band's good friend and longtime drum tech Chris Schmidt, who has previously played with Sunstorm project (along with Dennis Ward and Uwe Reitenauer), Harry Hess' FIRST SIGNAL and more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f8ece313bf905b3dc19e27447cfe66fec378aba","amp;dn":"Pink+Cream+69+FLAC+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f8ece313bf905b3dc19e27447cfe66fec378aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,142,206,49,59,249,5,179,220,25,226,116,71,207,230,111,236,55,138,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
