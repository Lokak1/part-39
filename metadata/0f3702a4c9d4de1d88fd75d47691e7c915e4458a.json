Frank Barnaby, nuclear weapons and terrorism expert, describes in straightforward, non-sensational terms what is involved when a state or a terrorist group sets out to make a weapon of mass destruction - biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear. But How to Build a Nuclear Bomb is not a collection of scare stories- Barnaby explains what a weapon of mass destruction is, what it is capable of doing, and what is needed to produce one and argues that counter-terrorist measures urgently need to be stepped up to meet the challenges of a new era of international terror.\n\nDiOS // 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3702a4c9d4de1d88fd75d47691e7c915e4458a","amp;dn":"How+to+build+a+nuclear+bomb+-+Frank+Barnaby+%5BPDF%5D+-+DiOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3702a4c9d4de1d88fd75d47691e7c915e4458a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,55,2,164,201,212,222,29,136,253,117,212,118,145,231,201,21,228,69,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
