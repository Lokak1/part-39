With topics usually centering on religion, politics, and current events, each of Pat's videos quickly caused a stir and racked up tens of thousands of views.\n\nRichardDawkins.net has now compiled 35 of Pat Condell's videos onto this DVD collection, with an exclusive introduction by Pat. Enjoy this newly remastered collection, totalling 3 hours of video.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPat Condell is unique. Nobody can match his extraordinary blend of suavity and savagery. With his articulate intelligence he runs rings around the religious wingnuts that are the targets of his merciless humour. Thank goodness he is on our side.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - Richard Dawkins \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBrash. Uncompromising. Brilliant. Hilarious. Pat Condell has found a simple formula for success: stating the obvious without restraining himself with the conventions of unwarranted piety. Pat flenses sacred cows, and after slicing away the fat and gristle of tired apologetics and mindless tradition, he exposes the hollow carcass of a culture's hypocrisy...and we laugh.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - PZ Myers\n\n\n01 - Introduction\n02 - Hello America - 18 February 07\n03 - What have I got against religion? - 04 March 07\n04 - The trouble with Islam - 16 March 07\n05 - What do I believe? - 28 March 07\n06 - Happy Easter - 05 April 07\n07 - Absolute certainty - 13 April 07\n08 - Religion in the UK - 17 April 07\n09 - In Jesus' name - 25 April 07\n10 - United States of Jesus - 03 May 07\n11 - Why are we friends with Saudi Arabia? - 14 May 07\n12 - Am I a racist? - 20 May 07\n13 - Miracles and morals - 29 May 07\n14 - Catholic morality - 04 June 07\n15 - Origin of the species - 13 June 07\n16 - The myth of Islamophobia - 21 June 07\n17 - What about the Jews? - 29 June 07\n18 - Politics and religion - 10 July 07\n19 - Why does faith deserve respect? - 19 July 07\n20 - God bless atheism - 03 August 07\n21 - Islam in Europe - 17 August 07\n22 - Unholy scripture - 31 August 07\n23 - Video response to Osama - 11 September 07\n24 - Hello angry Christians - 25 September 07\n25 - More demands from Islam - 09 October 07\n26 - What's good about religion? - 23 October 07\n27 - Was Jesus gay? - 02 November 07\n28 - A word to Islamofascists - 14 November 07\n29 - Why debate dogma? - 27 November 07\n30 - Laugh at Sudan - 03 December 07\n31 - Pimping for Jesus - 18 December 07\n32 - Partying with Baby Jesus - 24 December 07\n33 - Hook, line and rapure - 08 January 08\n34 - O dhimmi Canada - 19 January 08\n35 - God the psycho - 02 February 08\n\n\n\n=== The above torrent is a DVD rip and contains high quality video ===\n\n\n\nDownload Pat Condell's entire collection up to October 2008 (lower quality) from here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4441200/Pat_Condell_-_Critic_of_Religion_Par_Excellence_(all_videos)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4441200/Pat_Condell_-_Critic_of_Religion_Par_Excellence_(all_videos)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso check out Pat Condell's godless website: http://www.patcondell.net/\n\n\n=== Also ===\n\nHelp stop sharia law in the UK: http://www.shariapetition.com/\n\nFor more information on sharia law go to: http://www.onelawforall.org/\t\n\n============\n\nAlso check out my other torrents:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FreedomLover/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FreedomLover/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab5380b9d8274c70769cd142263e167e601d04b","amp;dn":"Pat+Condell%3A+Anthology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab5380b9d8274c70769cd142263e167e601d04b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,181,56,11,157,130,116,199,7,105,205,20,34,99,225,103,230,1,208,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
