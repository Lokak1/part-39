This was also the first studio release since the universally praised glory of Tattoo You and the '81 tour. Interestingly, the band did not go out of their way to replicate the classic rock sound of Tattoo You but instead tried to re-invent themselves for the 80's, exploring some new and &quot;Modern' sounds. Thankfully, it was a little too early in the Miami Vice decade for the &quot;Modern&quot; production techniques of the era to doom this record to sounding embarrassingly dated (see She's The Boss and Dirty Work for examples of this kind of unfortunate excess). Some of the highlights: \n\n1.Undercover of the Night: Title track, first single and centerpiece. Definitely the sound of the Stones re-inventing themselves for the 80's. Phased guitars, jungle rhythms and vaguely politically-themed lyrics suggesting the Central American bloodshed dominating the headlines at the time. This song is very catchy, quite rocking, not embarrassing or dated and earns the band points for trying something new and not just phoning in their performance. The band has been known to pull this one out for live performances over the years and is a welcome addition to their concerts. \n\n2.She Was Hot: Fun, lusty rocker that is good without being great. A little overproduced, this song would have benefited from a more raw production style. This one screams for inclusion in their live set, where it would potentially come into its own as a barn burner ala Respectable or Rip This Joint. \n\n3.Wanna Hold You: A decent rocker but not one of Keith's greatest songs; not bad either. I'd like to see Keith trot this one out for their next tour. \n\n4.Too Much Blood: The most `80's song here but in a good way. This is really a Mick song (the bizarre violence story lyrics recorded when he was drunk) with a guitar tech playing the main riff. Definitely intended for the dance floor, this track works and is considered by some Stones freaks as the best song on the record. Surprisingly, this still sounds fresh and not dated although it certainly is of its era. \n\n5.Pretty Beat Up: This has become my favorite track on the album. Don't believe the Jagger / Richards / Wood credits, this is a Ronnie song that those greedy bastids tacked their names onto. A totally cool 80's dance funk groover that manages to swing and rock at the same time, put this song on loud at your next blowout and watch your guests go nuts. Ronnie has been known to play this live in his solo sets and this is another one that just begs to be played live by the Stones. This is one of the great unappreciated Stones songs, ripe for rediscovery. \n\n6.Too Tough: This simple rocker has got classic status in its blood but never quite gels. It reminds me of Silver Train, a good song that you just know has greatness in it but never quite arrives. As a side note, a great Portland, OR bar band of the 80's and early 90's, The Batz, used to include this in their set and really made it come to life. \n\nNothing really wrong with the rest of the tracks on this album but I think of them as second tier in comparison to the former. As a matter of fact, if these last ones had been saved for Dirty Work, they would have been the highlights of that lackluster record. \n\n7. Tie You Up (the pain of love): A grinding, riffing groove-rocker. Okay. \n\n8. Feel On Baby: Another groover with a whiff of the jungle \n\n9. All The Way Down: The most Tattoo You-feeling track on the album. A generic rocker in the vein of Neighbors \n\n10. It Must Be Hell: A mid-tempo riff rocker, nothing to get too excited about.\n\nby Christopher Bushman\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Undercover Of The Night.wma                                      \n02 - She Was Hot.wma                                                  \n03 - Tie You Up (The Pain Of Love).wma                                \n04 - Wanna Hold You.wma                                               \n05 - Feel On Baby.wma                                                 \n06 - Too Much Blood.wma                                               \n07 - Pretty Beat Up.wma                                               \n08 - Too Tough.wma                                                    \n09 - All The Way Down.wma                                             \n10 - It Must Be Hell.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t\n\nFOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK PAGES: MARCELODRGZTPB\n\nATTENTION: I will read comments on all the material shared only on my Facebook page (MARCELODRGZTPB).
