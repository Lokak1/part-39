This release includes all the original (and only) album 'Like Gangbusters' together with the double A-side single 'She's Got Sex / Jealous Love' (which was also strangely covered by Samantha Fox!).\nDig Wayne's R&amp;B vocals lead a rousing stomp through a strange, infectious mix of Northern Soul. Formed from the remains of the punk band Subway Sect, JoBoxers sadly broke up before releasing the follow album 'Skin And Bone'.\nThis release also includes tracks recorded for the aborted follow up LP and is the only place to find the brilliant extended mix of 'She's Got Sex'. \nHighly, highly recommended. 'Bands Reunited' anyone? \nI was fortunate enough to see the Joboxers live 3 times. They will have you dancing for ages, as this album has some powerful stomping tunes on it. They supported Madness back in the 80's and Madness still speak highly of them even today! I'm not biased at all but you will realise when you hear this album that they could and should be around today in 2006. It's only a pitty that they are not here to play live for you. So this album is as near as you will get.. do yourself a favour.. Go BuyIt......... Now all we have is our Memories... \nTracklist&gt;\n1. Boxerbeat 3:04                    \n   2.
