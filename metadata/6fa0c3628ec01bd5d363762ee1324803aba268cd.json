(Animated Series)\n\n* SoyuzMultfilm - Color, USSR (Russia)\n* Director: Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin.\n* Animated by: Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin.\n* Written By: Feliks Kamov, Arkadi Khajt, Aleksandr Kurlyandsky\n* Art Director: Svyatozar Rusakov\n* Vocal Talent: Anatoli Papanov (The Wolf), Klara Rumyanova (Rabbit)\n* Originally Released on January 01, 1969 aired on Soviet-TV\n\n\n\n&quot;Nu, pogodi&quot; (or &quot;Wait, I'll get you!&quot; is a cartoon series from Russia. Not\nto be confused with the German band bearing the same name.\n\nHere's what the &quot;Big Cartoon database&quot; has to say about it: \n\n&quot;Originally started as a &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; wannabe, the series \nevolved into a completely different phenomenon. The chases, \nspills and cartoon character mangling are still there- \nbut the series are also a poignant social satire. The Wolf \nis a chain-smoking motorcycle-riding beer-guzzling proletarian. \nThe Rabbit has all the childish innocence and enthusiasm of \nproperly raised Soviet youth - and yet displays odd homoerotic \ntendencies that were obviously missed by the government censors.\n\nThere is almost no dialogue, so it remains understandable by people \nwho speak no Russian, although non-Russians are unlikely to get the \n&quot;easter egg gags&quot; hidden in the soundtrack and obscure pop-culture \nreferences which are plentiful.\n\nThe soundtrack is a medley of pop tunes, each providing a \ncommentary on the action and (to a person knowledgeable in '70s \nSoviet pop-music) is often funnier then the action. The few \noriginal pieces written for the show were performed by (at the time) \nthe only Electronic Instruments Orchestra in Russia (featuring weird \nanalog synthesizers, theremins and other interesting devices).&quot;\n\nAfter Anatoli Papanov's death, his voice was sampled and used in later series.\n\nThe full series has been released on VHS and VCD and is available in \nmany stores that carry Eastern European books and videos. \n\n(from http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/detailed.cgi?film=51216&amp;p=s )\n\n\nYou can also find more details about it at:\nhttp://www.russianword.com/shopping/B00005A8YK.htm\n\n\nScreenshots:\nhttp://www.iddk.ru/en/cdrom/52029.html\n\nLCD Game SWF Included! I actually owned a real one at one time while growing up :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fa0c3628ec01bd5d363762ee1324803aba268cd","amp;dn":"Nu_Pagadi-Classic_Soviet_Era_Cartoon_Series-%2818+Eps-DivX-RU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fa0c3628ec01bd5d363762ee1324803aba268cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,160,195,98,142,192,27,213,211,99,118,46,225,50,72,3,171,162,104,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
