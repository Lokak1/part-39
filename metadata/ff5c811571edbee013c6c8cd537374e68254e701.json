Geoffrey de Ste. Croix shows how even its oddest features made sense, and illustrates the different factors influencing Athenian politics--for instance, trade and commercial interests mattered very little. Though written in the 1960s, these hitherto unpublished essays remain fresh and innovative.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;No serious reader, converted or not, could emerge unimpressed by the sheer command of evidence and calibre of argument on display here.&quot;--Bryn Mawr Classical Review\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nGeoffrey de Ste.
