(or So Fucking What) is a 1994 film, directed by Jefery Levy. It is based on a novel by Andrew, and stars Stephen Dorff, Jake Busey and Reese Witherspoon; in one of her first lead roles.\n\n\nCliff Spab (Stephen Dorff) and his friend Joe Dice (Jack Noseworthy) go out one evening to buy some beer in a convenience store. While there, a group of masked and heavily armed terrorists take Cliff, Joe, and three other people hostage. The terrorists, who call themselves S.P.L.T. Image, have a video camera, and they tape their hostages. During the month-long standoff with the police, S.P.L.T. Image's only demand is that their broadcasts be televised on worldwide television live and uncut, or else the hostages will be killed. After two of the hostages are killed, Cliff, Joe and another hostageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a young teenage girl named Wendy Pfister (Reese Witherspoon)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are the only ones left. After 36 days, Cliff becomes indifferent to being killed, and he says repeatedly, &quot;So fucking what?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in reply to his captors' threats to kill him. Because of the coverage, this makes Cliff a media icon.\n\n\n\nDirector.................................Jefery Levy\nWriters..................................Andrew Wellman (novel)\n                                            Danny Rubin (screenplay)\n\t\t\t        Jefery Levy (screenplay)\n\nCast:\nStephen Dorff ...................Cliff Spab\nReese Witherspoon...........Wendy Pfister\nJake Busey......................Morrow Streeter\nJoey Lauren Adams..........Monica Dice\nPamela Gidley..................Janet Streeter\nDavid Barry Gray..............Scott Spab\nJack Noseworthy..............Joe Dice\nRichard Portnow...............Gerald Parsley\nEdward Wiley...................Mr. Spab\nLela Ivey...........................Mrs. Spab\n\n\nRelease Date.................20 January 1995 (USA) \nGenre...........................Comedy | Drama\nLanguage.....................English\nSubtitles......................No\nFormat........................avi  \nRunning Time..............01:35:24\nSize...........................914mb\nRipper........................ImTOO DVD Ripper Platinum 4\nimdb..........................http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111048/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoundtrack (This is not the official soundtrack; it is compiled from the music listed in the credits.\n\n1.
