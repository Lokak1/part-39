Since her husband died three years ago, Gaby's four children have drifted apart, each consumed by the turbulence of their own lives. They haven't celebrated Christmas together since their father's death, but when Gaby announces that she's getting married--and that the groom will remain a secret until the wedding day--she may finally be able to bring them home for the holidays.\n\nBut the wedding isn't Gaby's only surprise--she has one more gift for her children, and it could change all their lives forever. With deeply affecting characters and the emotional twists of a James Patterson thriller, The Christmas Wedding is a fresh look at family and the magic of the season.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85ac2390f518c6ec748f6069d4e17a032749b993","amp;dn":"The+Christmas+Wedding+-+James+Patterson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85ac2390f518c6ec748f6069d4e17a032749b993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,172,35,144,245,24,198,236,116,143,96,105,212,225,122,3,39,73,185,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
