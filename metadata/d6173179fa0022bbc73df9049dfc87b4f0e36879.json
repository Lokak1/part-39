Use imgburn to write the disk with all default settings.  For best results, you probably want to use Memorex DVD +R DL media.  If you want more information on the hack, search the internet... there is a lot out there.  \n\nThis disc makes it possible to use the Toyota Navigation System (in compatible vehicles) to be used while the car is moving.  This version requires you to hit 'I Agree' every time the car is turned on (newer retail versions don't have this limitation, they simply display a warning temporarily).\n\nTo activate the override:\n\nPower car on, hit I agree\nPress Menu on the nav system\nChoose Volume on the screen\nTouch the top left corner of the display\nTouch the lower left corner of the display\nTouch the top left corner of the display again\nTouch the lower left corner of the display again\nPress and hold the override soft button until it beeps (override should stay highlighted)\nClick back or just hit map, etc... use the nav (Drive carefully!!!)\nRepeat every time you restart.\n\nThere are other instructions on how to get it to load the new disk the first time... look for them.  I think for most vehicles (non-Hybrid) you just disconnect the negative battery terminal for a minute or so.  With the Camry Hybrid, you need to remove Radio1 fuse for about a minute (I switched the disk first) and replace it...  IF you get any weird can't read disc errors... try a different media.  If you want to go back, put the old disc in and do the battery / fuse thing again.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6173179fa0022bbc73df9049dfc87b4f0e36879","amp;dn":"Toyota+Navigation+Gen+5+v+8.1+%28Hybrid+5.1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6173179fa0022bbc73df9049dfc87b4f0e36879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,23,49,121,250,0,34,187,199,61,249,4,157,252,135,180,240,227,104,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
