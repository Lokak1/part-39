Using the name Abdominal, he formed his first rap crew with DJ Serious and Scott C. called Rushholme and they started recording tracks. A chance meeting in 1998 with DJ Fase led to them teaming up as Abs &amp; Fase. They began recording and released the limited single Vinyl Frontier. This drew the attention of DJ Format and led to them collaborating. Abdominal's raps became a standout feature on DJ Format's first album, Music For the Mature B-Boy, released in 2003. From 2003 to 2005 they toured as part of Jurassic 5's European tour while in 2004 Abs and Fase released an album called Flowtation Device. Abdominal also appeared on DJ Format's second album, If You Can't Join 'EmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Beat 'Em, in 2005, alongside fellow Canadian rapper, D-Sisive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ff667af82a2b320781f7325ad0d62990172867","amp;dn":"abdominal+12+inch+by+numadu51+freestyle+vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ff667af82a2b320781f7325ad0d62990172867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,255,102,122,248,42,43,50,7,129,247,50,90,208,214,41,144,23,40,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
