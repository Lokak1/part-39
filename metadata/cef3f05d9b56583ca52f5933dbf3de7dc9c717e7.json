This is a full ISO rip of the Live DVD so you will need a Program Slysoft Virtual CloneDrive or Daemon Tools in order to view it (windows 8 Includes the ability to mount ISO natively).\n\nENJOY !!! If you need a reseed or something (I could also turn this into an AVI so it has a much smaller Filesize) Leave a comment and I'll try and fix you up.
