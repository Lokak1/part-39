The remaining Pipers (Billy Wilson, Chuck Lowry, Jo Stafford, and her then-husband John Huddleston) joined the Tommy Dorsey Band in 1939, backing Sinatra on many classic recordings. In 1942 The Pied Pipers broke away from Dorsey, and Huddleston joined the army, to be replaced by Hal Hopper, one of the original eight members. The group backed Johnny Mercer on several tracks during the early 40s, including &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;Blues in the Night.&quot; Their first single (&quot;Deacon Jones&quot;/&quot;Pistol Packin&amp;#039; Mama&quot;) was released in 1943. Stafford had become quite busy with her solo career and left the group in 1944, to be replaced by June Hutton. Throughout the rest of the decade The Pied Pipers charted frequently, yet their popularity waned in the &amp;#039;50s. \n\nPied Pipers\n===========\n\nWhat Can I Say After I Say I&amp;#039;m Sorry\nAren&amp;#039;t You&amp;#039;re Glad You&amp;#039;re You\nCharming Little Faker\nCome Rain Or Come Shine\nCome To Baby Do\nDoctor, Lawyer And Indian Chief\nDoin&amp;#039; What Comes Natur&amp;#039;lly\nDolores\nEasy Street\nEmbraceable You\nFree For All\nFriendship\nFunny Little Pedro\nGotta Be This Or That\nI Love It So\nI&amp;#039;ll Buy That Dream\nI&amp;#039;ll Take Tallulah\nI&amp;#039;ve Got The Sun In The Morning\nIn The Middle Of May\nIsn&amp;#039;t That Just Like Love\nIt&amp;#039;s Only A Paper Moon\nJust A-Sittin&amp;#039; And A-Rockin&amp;#039;\nLet&amp;#039;s Get Away From It All\nLinger In My Arms A Little Longer, Baby\nLove Sends A Little Gift Of Roses\nMy Gal Sal\nMy My\nMy Sugar Is So Refined\nNew Text Document\nNine Old Me\nRagtime Cowboy Joe\nRoute 66\nSentimental Journey\nSweet Potato Piper\nTampico\nThe Night We Called It A Day\nThere&amp;#039;s A Boat Dat&amp;#039;s Leavin&amp;#039; Soon For New York\nThere&amp;#039;s Good Blues Tonight\nWhat A Deal\nWhat Ya Gonna Do\nWhatcha Know Joe\nWhy Does It Get Late So Early\nWinter Weather\nYou Might Have Belonged To Another\nYou Say The Sweetest Things, Baby\nYou Won&amp;#039;t Be Satisfied\nYou&amp;#039;ve Got Me This Way","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bb9b324250acda5fb194623b1afc5a1acb48a20","amp;dn":"Pied+Pipers+-+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bb9b324250acda5fb194623b1afc5a1acb48a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,185,179,36,37,10,205,165,251,25,70,35,177,175,197,161,172,180,138,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
