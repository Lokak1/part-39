He had what he later described as &quot;the most shattering experience of his life&quot;. Leary became a spokesman for LSD and the psychedelic movement, encouraging people to &quot;tune in, turn on, and drop out&quot;. In 1963, he and Richard Alpert were fired from their positions at Harvard after which they both lived at Millbrook for a time. At Milbrook they continued to work with psychedelics both therapeutically and recreationally...with the occasional help of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Abbie Hoffman and Aldous Huxley. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69aa3b44192d5ae89ce86156c84d52849ed1f5d0","amp;dn":"Timothy+Leary+-+Turn+on%2C+Tune+in%2C+Drop+out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69aa3b44192d5ae89ce86156c84d52849ed1f5d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,170,59,68,25,45,90,232,156,232,97,86,200,77,82,132,158,209,245,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
