Whitaker was probably most well known for books written under his other nom de plume, Trevanian.\n\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevanian for more information.\n\nThis book is long out of print and under dubious copyright status. This electronic version was scanned, in the public interest and for no financial remuneration, from the hardcover first edition, originally published by Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., in 1983.\n\nThe text has been proofed and checked to the best of my ability, and formatted as close to the original as possible. The original illustrations by William Bramhall are included as well.\n\nMay the writings of Mr. Whitaker be available and enjoyed for as long as possible, his true legacy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df3c9c5974715f612667209e6848fe20b7a4db5","amp;dn":"Rude.Tales.and.Glorious_Nicholas.Seare_mobi.epub.zip.txt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df3c9c5974715f612667209e6848fe20b7a4db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,243,201,197,151,71,21,246,18,102,114,9,230,132,143,226,11,122,77,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
