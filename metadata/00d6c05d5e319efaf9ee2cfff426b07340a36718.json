The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00d6c05d5e319efaf9ee2cfff426b07340a36718","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers-What+Hits%21+1992+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00d6c05d5e319efaf9ee2cfff426b07340a36718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,214,192,93,94,49,158,250,249,238,44,255,244,38,176,115,64,163,103,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
