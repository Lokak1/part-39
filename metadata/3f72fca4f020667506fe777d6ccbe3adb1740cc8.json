We&amp;#039;re coming up on the end of this amazingly written series and I noticed it&amp;#039;s kind of hard to find the last 4 or 5 issues so I made this update (from files found in dcp&amp;#039;s and what not) in order to have them in one neat little place. Whether your reading for the first time or catching up to get ready for the finale this is what you&amp;#039;re looking for.  It should be current up until mid September (because it&amp;#039;s being released semi-monthly now.\n\nAs an aside, Y - The last Man has been picked up by New Line Cinema and will be directed by D.J. Caruso of the film &quot;Suburbia&quot;. Roomer has it Shia LaBeouf will get the lead part and it will go into production shortly after he&amp;#039;s done filming Indiana Jones 4 and should be released late in 2009.\n\nBrian K. Vaughan&amp;#039;s other excellent graphic novel &quot;Ex Machina&quot; has also been purchased by New Line but has no production date set. Anyone know where to find the last 7 or so Ex Machina torrents (the zcult links are not working).\n\nFor more from Vaughn check out the next season of ABC&amp;#039;s &quot;Lost&quot;, he&amp;#039;s on the writing staff now.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f72fca4f020667506fe777d6ccbe3adb1740cc8","amp;dn":"Y+-+The+Last+Man+%231-57","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f72fca4f020667506fe777d6ccbe3adb1740cc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,114,252,164,240,32,102,117,6,254,119,125,108,203,227,173,177,116,12,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
