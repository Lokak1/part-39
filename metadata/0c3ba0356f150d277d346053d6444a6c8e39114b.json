Had a hard time finding the proper setup on the \n\ninternet so I'm gonna seed this as long as I can.\n\nInstallation is pretty simple.\n\n1. Run INSTALL.EXE\n\n2. Enter the drive in which the setup is located. (C:, D:, ...)\n\n3. Enter directory location of the setup. (This uses DOS style directory names \n\nlimited to 8-10 characters, most probably the directory will already be entered.)\n\n4. After that, you get to select where exactly you want to install the software.\n\n5. After installion in complete the setup will ask you to make certain modifications \n\nto your config.sys file which will be located in your root directory. \n\n(Example:-C:CONFIG.SYS )\n\n\nThen go to the installed directory &gt; TC &gt; BIN &gt; TC.EXE\n\nEnjoy coding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c3ba0356f150d277d346053d6444a6c8e39114b","amp;dn":"Turbo+C%2B%2B+v1.01+from+Borland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c3ba0356f150d277d346053d6444a6c8e39114b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,59,160,53,111,21,13,39,125,52,96,83,214,68,74,108,142,57,17,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
