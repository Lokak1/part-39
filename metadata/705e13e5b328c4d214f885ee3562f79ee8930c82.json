It was contested for the Heavyweight Championship of the World at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines on Wednesday, October 1, 1975. The contest's name is derived from the frequent rhyming boast made by Ali that the fight would be a &quot;Killa and a Thrilla and a Chilla, when I get that gorilla in Manila&quot;.\n\nThe bout is consistently ranked as one of the best in the sport's history and proved to be the culmination of the bitter rivalry between Ali and Frazier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:705e13e5b328c4d214f885ee3562f79ee8930c82","amp;dn":"Thrilla+in+Manilla+-+01.10.1975.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"705e13e5b328c4d214f885ee3562f79ee8930c82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,94,19,229,179,40,196,210,20,248,133,238,53,98,247,158,232,147,12,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
