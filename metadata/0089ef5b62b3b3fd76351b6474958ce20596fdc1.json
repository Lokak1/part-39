The album, which garnered her a Crossroads Silver Star and a four-star rating in Rolling Stone, had critics comparing her self-described &quot;country noir&quot; to the likes of Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, John Prine, and, not surprisingly, Lucinda Williams. The success of Drag Queens led to main-stage shows at festivals around the country and multiple tours in Europe. \n\nWith strong songwriting and powerful vocals, the alternative country album Drag Queens in Limousines might be a pleasant surprise for some who try to judge it by its unusual title alone. \n\nThis 1999 sophomore album was recorded by Louisiana native Mary Gauthier. Of course, most of the numbers on this award-winning offering aren't your everyday kind of country. Some of the lyrics have even been called brutally honest. One of the songs, &quot;Karla Faye,&quot; is about a Texas death row inmate by that name. Other numbers are simply about the rejects of society and the struggles that most people face at one point or another. Gauthier is a talented singer and completely capable of sharing her emotions through her lyrics.\n\n\n01  Drag Queens In Limousines\n02  Our Lady Of The Shooting Stars\n03  Karla Faye\n04  I Drink\n05  Evangeline\n06  Lucky Stars\n07  Different Kind Of Gone\n08  Slip Of The Tongue\n09  Lifetime\n10  Jackie's Train\n\n\nIf you like the music, buy it!\t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0089ef5b62b3b3fd76351b6474958ce20596fdc1","amp;dn":"Mary+Gauthier+-+Drag+Queens+In+Limousines+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0089ef5b62b3b3fd76351b6474958ce20596fdc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,137,239,91,98,179,179,253,118,53,27,100,116,149,140,226,5,150,253,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
