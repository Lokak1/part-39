Beyond the kids. You'll go on living, doing things. This isn't it.&quot;\n\nI know, I assure him. I have the kids. They need me. They're my life now.\n\n&quot;OK,&quot; he replies, then gruntsÃ¢â‚¬â€more of a brief hum. He only hums when he thinks I'm full of shit.\n\nShockingly single. Amy Biancolli's life went off script more dramatically than most after her husband of twenty years jumped off the roof of a parking garage. Left with three children, a three-story house, and a pile of knotty psychological complications, Amy realizes the flooding dishwasher, dead car battery, rapidly growing lawn, basement sump pump, and broken doorknob aren't going to fix themselves. She also realizes that &quot;figuring shit out&quot; means accepting the horrors that came her way, rolling with them, slogging through them, helping others through theirs, and working her way through life with love and laughter.\n\nAmy Biancolli is an author and journalist whose column appears in the Albany Times Union. Before that, Amy served as film critic for the Houston Chronicle where her reviews, published around the country, won her the 2007 Comment and Criticism Award from the Texas Associated Press Managing Editors Association. Biancolli is the author of House of Holy Fools: A Family Portrait in Six Cracked Parts, which earned her Albany Author of the Year. Amy lives in Albany, New York, with her three children.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9260a4d55fe599cfb63c9a4197ffb4761a15d67","amp;dn":"Figuring+Sh%21t+Out-+Amy+Biancolli+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9260a4d55fe599cfb63c9a4197ffb4761a15d67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,38,10,77,85,254,89,156,251,99,201,164,25,127,251,71,97,161,93,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
