Taylor, Olle Heinonen\n\nimage\n\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 426 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (March 18, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521778271\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nReview\n&quot;Taylor and Heinonen have prepared a fine graduate-level introduction to the traditional core of condensed matter physics, the quantum theory of solids... Taylor's book is a worthwhile addition for any university with a graduate program in condensed matter physics of related fields.&quot; Choice\n\nBook Description\nThis textbook is a reader-friendly introduction to the theory that underlies the many fascinating properties of solids. Assuming only an elementary knowledge of quantum mechanics, it describes the methods by which one can perform calculations and make predictions of some of the many complex phenomena that occur in solids and quantum liquids. This book, aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students, leads the reader from the fundamental behaviour of electrons and atoms in solids to the most recently explored manifestations of the quantum nature of condensed matter.\n\nThis reader-friendly introduction to the theory that underlies the many fascinating properties of solids assumes only an elementary knowledge of quantum mechanics.
