Right now you are probably thinking, &quot;oh, another one of those&quot;? Or perhaps not. Chances are that you have never heard about &quot;linear prediction&quot;, although most of us use it daily when we talk on our cell phones. Linear prediction coding is a voice compression technology that appeared in commercial products in the seventies and was implemented in some well-known speaking toys of the early eighties.\n\nWe have applied this technology to create a VST / AU effect plug-in that analyzes audio, extracts a number of parameters (including pitch, volume and formant data) and then resynthesizes the audio using a simple oscillator, noise and filter architecture.\n\nWe have added a number of playback parameters that adjusts the pitch and tonal quality of the sound as well as support for MIDI and a beat-synchronized &quot;formant freezing effect&quot;. Despite having only a few simple controls, this box can produce a broad range of sounds from cheap speaking toys to high-end vocoder and talkbox effects.\n\n\n\n\nCode:\nRequirements\n\n\nThe minimum requirements for installing and running Bitspeek under Microsoft Windows\nare:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Microsoft Windows XP or later\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A host application that supports 32-bit or 64-bit VST 2.4 plug-ins\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 1GHz Pentium IV or equivalent\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 5MB of free disk space\n\n\n\nInstall\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install.\n3.Replace files with our cracked ones.\n4.Run the plugin and start registration.\n5.Input your (fake) name, (fake) email and any serials, then register.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
