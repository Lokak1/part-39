Researched and compiled by longtime Monkee maniacs Andrew Sandoval and Bill Inglot, Headquarters Sessions collects almost four hours of unique audio insight into the recording of this Monkee milestone. It includes almost three-and-one-half-hours of alternate takes, demos, backing tracks, and recording session audio hijinx never before preserved on compact disc. \n\n\n WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve combed through all of the known surviving Headquarters session reels -both complete and intermediate mixes- to assemble a strikingly cohesive peek into The MonkeesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ inner workings as a finally unencumbered creative entity and as the genuine -if sometimes still learning- musicians that they were. To this end, Headquarters Sessions includes only recordings from those sessions where the band had control over all aspects of the recording process and where they played most, if not all, of the instruments. The 3-CD set collects all of the vocal masters from these sessions that were not included on the original stereo album as well as all of the surviving vocal demos and a few tracks with vocals which were never completed. \n\n However, the beefy middle of this tasty digital triple-decker is the collection of previously unreleased instrumental backing track sessions (both for familiar and previously unknown compositions), rehearsals, spoken word oddities, and studio chatter. And to top it all off, the original mono masters are presented in an initially proposed, but ultimately unused, running order. All contained in a gatefold digipack with a 40-page booklet filled with photographs, a contemporaneous day-to-day chronology, track notes as well as interesting ephemera. Headquarters Sessions is sure to make you a believer.\n\n#  SheÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s So Far Out, SheÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s In TRACKING SESSION TAKES 1 &amp; 2\n# The Girl I Knew Somewhere (First Version) TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE TAKES 1 TO 16\n# The Girl I Knew Somewhere (First Version) MASTER BACKING TRACK TAKE 22\n# All Of Your Toys REHEARSAL\n# All Of Your Toys TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE TAKES 1 TO 10\n# All Of Your Toys MASTER BACKING TRACK TAKE 20 MONO MIX\n# The Girl I Knew Somewhere (Second Version) TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE FEATURING TAKE 15\n# The Girl I Knew Somewhere (Second Version) TRACKING OVERDUB SESSION TAKES 1 &amp; 2\n# The Girl I Knew Somewhere (Second Version) MASTER BACKING TRACK TAKE 13A\n# SeegerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Theme DEMO\n# Can You Dig It DEMO\n# Nine Times Blue DEMO VOCAL\n# Until ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Time For You To Go DEMO VOCAL\n# SheÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll Be There DEMO VOCAL\n# Midnight Train DEMO VOCAL\n# Sunny Girlfriend ACOUSTIC REMIX OF MASTER VOCAL\n# Sunny Girlfriend TRACKING SESSION TAKE 7 WITH SCRATCH VOCAL VOCAL\n# Mr Webster TRACKING SESSION TAKE 28\n# Band 6 STEREO MASTER\n# Setting Up The Studio For Randy Scouse Git\n# Randy Scouse Git TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE\n# Randy Scouse Git ALTERNATE VERSION TAKE 18 VOCAL\n# You Told Me MASTER BACKING TRACK\n# Monkee Chat STUDIO DIALOGUE\n# You Told Me TAKE 15 WITH ROUGH LEAD VOCAL\n# Zilch PETER TORK VOCAL TRACK SPOKEN WORD\n# Zilch DAVY JONES VOCAL TRACK SPOKEN WORD\n# Zilch MICKY DOLENZ VOCAL TRACK SPOKEN WORD\n# Zilch MICHAEL NESMITH VOCAL TRACK SPOKEN WORD\n# IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll Spend My Life With You MASTER BACKING TRACK TAKE 9\n# Randy Scouse Git MASTER BACKING TRACK TAKE 23\n# Forget That Girl REHEARSAL\n# Forget That Girl MASTER BACKING TRACK\n# Where Has It All Gone (First Version) TRACKING SESSION TAKE 1\n# Memphis Tennessee\n# Twelve-String Improvisation\n# Where Has It All Gone (Second Version) MASTER BASIC TRACK TAKE 12\n# Jericho\n# Forget That Girl ROUGH BACKING VOCALS\n# Peter GunnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Gun\n# I Was Born In East Virginia INFORMAL RECORDING VOCAL\n# Forget That Girl REJECTED OVERDUB SESSION VOCAL\n# Randy Scouse Git ALTERNATE MIX WITH UNUSED TAG VOCAL\n# Micky In Carlsbad Cavern STUDIO DIALOGUE\n# Pillow Time TAKE 1 VOCAL\n# Shades Of Gray MASTER BACKING TRACK TAKE 9B\n# Masking Tape TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE TAKES 6 TO 8\n# You Just May Be The One TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE\n# You Just May Be The One MASTER BACKING TRACK\n# No Time (First Version) TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE TAKES 3 TO 5\n# Blues (Excerpt)\n# I CanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t Get Her Off My Mind MASTER BACKING TRACK\n# Banjo Jam (Excerpt)\n# Cripple Creek\n# Six-String Improvisation\n# The Story Of Rock And Roll (First Version) TRACKING SESSION TAKE 23\n# Early Morning Blues And Greens MASTER BACKING TRACK\n# Two-Part Invention In F Major INFORMAL RECORDING\n# The Story Of Rock And Roll (Second Version) TRACKING SESSION TAKE 5A\n# DonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t Be Cruel\n# For PeteÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Sake MASTER BACKING TRACK\n# No Time (Second Version) TRACKING SESSION COMPOSITE\n# No Time (Second Version) MASTER BACKING TRACK TAKE 7A\n# Just A Game DEMO TAKES 1 To 3\n# Fever\n# Sunny Girlfriend MASTER BACKING TRACK\n# No Time (Second Version) MASTER TAKE 7A WITH BACKING VOCALS\n# All Of Your Toys MONO MASTER\n# The Girl I Knew Somewhere (First Version) MONO MASTER\n# For PeteÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Sake MONO MASTER\n# IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll Spend My Life With You MONO MASTER\n# Forget That Girl MONO MASTER\n# You Just May Be The One MONO MASTER\n# Shades Of Gray MONO MASTER\n# Band 6 MONO MASTER\n# Sunny Girlfriend MONO MASTER\n# Mr Webster MONO MASTER\n# You Told Me MONO MASTER\n# The Girl I Knew Somewhere (Second Version) MONO MASTER\n# 29.
