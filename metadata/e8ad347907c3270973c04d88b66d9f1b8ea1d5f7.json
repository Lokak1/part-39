It has been certified Platinum in the United States and gave the band a #1 hit with the title track.\nLike another rock outfit updating their sound with synth grooves, ZZ Top, Miller merged the two styles together and scored one of the biggest radio hits of 1982--&quot;Abracadabra.&quot; While the album of the same name performed well on the charts due to the single's success, it wasn't on par with his earlier, more focused records, making Miller's synth-pop crossover success short lived.\n\nBy the dawn of the '80s, some rock giants of the previous decade found themselves having a hard time making the musical transition to new styles. While most artists attempted to update their hard rocking sound with such '80s musical elements as synthesizers and pop-friendly production, etc., for some such innovations spelled disaster. However, for others such as Steve Miller, they spelled big, albeit brief, chart success.\n\nTracklist\n1.&quot;Keeps Me Wondering Why&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n2.&quot;Abracadabra&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n3.&quot;Something Special&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n4.&quot;Give It Up&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n5.&quot;Never Say No&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n6.&quot;Things I Told You&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n7.&quot;Young Girl's Heart&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n8.&quot;Goodbye Love&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n9.&quot;Cool Magic&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n10.&quot;While I'm Waiting&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n\n\nPersonnel\nSteve Miller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar, Synclavier\nJohn Massaro ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nKenny Lee Lewis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nNorton Buffalo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica\nByron Allred ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\nGary Mallaber ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion, keyboards\nGreg Douglass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar on tracks 3 &amp; 8\nLonnie Turner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar on tracks 3 &amp; 8\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8ad347907c3270973c04d88b66d9f1b8ea1d5f7","amp;dn":"Steve+Miller+Band+Abracadabra%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8ad347907c3270973c04d88b66d9f1b8ea1d5f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,173,52,121,7,195,39,9,115,192,77,136,182,109,159,27,142,161,213,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
