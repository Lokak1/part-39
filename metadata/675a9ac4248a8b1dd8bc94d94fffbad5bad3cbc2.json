Bowe, however, refused to meet Lewis' financial demands and subsequently vacated the title rather than face Lewis and in turn, the WBC named Lewis its Heavyweight champion. Holyfield was able to regain the WBA, IBF and Lineal heavyweight titles in a rematch with Bowe, but then lost the titles in his first defense against southpaw Michael Moorer. Shortly after, Lewis would lose his WBC Heavyweight title to Oliver McCall, putting the much anticipated HolyfieldÃ¢â‚¬â€œLewis unification bout on hold for several years. By 1996, the four Heavyweight titles were separated due in part to both the IBF and WBA stripping George Foreman of their Heavyweight titles, though he continued to be recognized as the Lineal Heavyweight champion. Meanwhile, Bruce Seldon defeated Tony Tucker to win the vacant WBA title, while Moorer regained the vacant IBF Heavyweight title he had lost to Foreman by defeating Axel Schulz. Mike Tyson would then defeat Frank Bruno to capture the WBC Heavyweight title only to vacate it in order to challenge and defeat Seldon to win the WBA Heavyweight title, setting the stages for the highly anticipated TysonÃ¢â‚¬â€œHolyfield match in which Holyfield upset Tyson to win the WBA title. Next up for Holyfield was a victory against Moorer in a rematch would unify the WBA and IBF Heavyweight championships. Lewis, on the other hand, would recapture the vacant WBC title by defeating McCall and then defeat Shannon Briggs for the Lineal Heavyweight championship. After Holyfield and Lewis made their mandatory defenses against Vaughn Bean and Ã…Â½eljko MavroviÃ„â€¡ respectively, the two men would finally meet for the Undisputed Heavyweight championship. Prior to the fight Lewis would hire Holyfield's former trainer Emanuel Steward, meanwhile, the normally mild-mannered Holyfield would uncharacteristicly predict that he would dominate the first two rounds before knocking out Lewis in the third[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:675a9ac4248a8b1dd8bc94d94fffbad5bad3cbc2","amp;dn":"Evander+Holyfield+vs+Lennox+Lewis+I.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"675a9ac4248a8b1dd8bc94d94fffbad5bad3cbc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,90,154,196,36,138,139,29,216,188,148,217,79,255,186,213,186,211,203,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
