She claimed an unprecedented victory at the 2011 French Open at age twenty-nine, and became the first player from an Asian country to win a Grand Slam singles title. Outspoken and likeable, the 'late-blooming' Chinese tennis superstar is one of the world's top ten players, and has championships on grass, clay and hard courts to her name.\n\nBeyond the rankings and million-dollar endorsements is a life just as remarkable as her success. Li Na grew up within a rigid national sports system, living away from home and training six days a week, and spent years struggling to believe in herself. Her outstanding feats in a sport she grew to love, recovering from three knee surgeries and conquering her own demons, are nothing short of inspirational.\n\nTold with honesty and humour, Li Na: My Life is the moving story behind an extraordinary sporting icon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6e2516d459943c51c60951f12d6759c63f35148","amp;dn":"Li+Na+-+My+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6e2516d459943c51c60951f12d6759c63f35148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,226,81,109,69,153,67,197,28,96,149,31,18,214,117,156,99,243,81,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
