Based in part on a series of lectures he gave in the United States in 1951, this book examines Buber's interpretations of Western thinking and belief around this notion of lost intimacy or direct contact with the Divine, focusing particularly on the relationships between religion and philosophy, ethics, and Jungian psychology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cb509d8553b16dbfe3cd3e20a85df4df84ffa4e","amp;dn":"Martin+Buber+-+Eclipse+of+God+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cb509d8553b16dbfe3cd3e20a85df4df84ffa4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,181,9,216,85,59,22,219,254,60,211,226,10,133,223,77,248,79,250,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
