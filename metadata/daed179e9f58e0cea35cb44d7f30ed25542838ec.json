Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, itâ€™s a melting pot where animals from every environment live togetherâ€”a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when rookie officer Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin) arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isnâ€™t so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman), to solve the mystery. Walt Disney Animation Studiosâ€™ â€œZootopia,â€ a comedy-adventure directed by Byron Howard (â€œTangled,â€ â€œBoltâ€) and Rich Moore (â€œWreck-It Ralph,â€ â€œThe Simpsonsâ€), opens in theaters on March 4, 2016.\r\n\r\nDirector: Byron Howard, Rich Moore\r\n\r\nActors: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy, Action and Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daed179e9f58e0cea35cb44d7f30ed25542838ec","amp;dn":"Zootopia.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%232+%5BHD%5D+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daed179e9f58e0cea35cb44d7f30ed25542838ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,237,23,158,159,88,224,206,163,92,180,77,127,48,237,37,84,40,56,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
