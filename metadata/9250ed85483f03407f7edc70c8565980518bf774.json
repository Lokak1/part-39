Heavy Bass, so EQ accordingly. Will revisit this to edit in Soundforge in near future.\nGreat Gilmour Solo in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poles ApartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was played sparingly throughout the Division Bell World Tour in 1994. Shine On Is Clear Except for a few shoutheads in the beginning. Otherwise a great end to Disc One.\nDisc Two standout is Nice Comfortably Numb. Great Energy from Band and AUD.\nThanks and Enjoy!\nFrom Yeeshkul","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9250ed85483f03407f7edc70c8565980518bf774","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+1994-04-16+Your+Favorite+Disease+Pasadena+CA+Rose+Bow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9250ed85483f03407f7edc70c8565980518bf774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,80,237,133,72,63,3,64,127,126,220,112,200,86,89,128,81,139,247,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
