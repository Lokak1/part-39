Maggie and Wayne overcome the offender and take him into custody. Back at the station he is quickly identified as one of three bandits who held up the St. David's bank the previous day. The prisoner proves to be uncooperative. He refuses to give his name or those of his accomplices and in an unguarded moment, he swallows a handful of thumbtacks. Although Mt. Thomas Hospital is presently under renovations, there is still a skeleton staff there and the bandit is rushed into emergency surgery under the care of Dr. Zoe Hamilton.\n\n(encoded with Handbrake - Blue Heelers - from Complete Third Season DVD - the early years)\n\nDuration: approximately 45 minutes\nAspect ratio: 4:3 standard\nAudio: linear hi-fi/stereo\nSize: 509MB\nVideo format: MPEG-4 (MP4)\n\nPlease seed as much as possible after downloading.\n\nNOTE: the description has been edited as it was too long.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a0735982a961e4bf2d5cabe478f7b17e8180f07","amp;dn":"Blue+Heelers+S03E01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a0735982a961e4bf2d5cabe478f7b17e8180f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,7,53,152,42,150,30,75,242,213,202,190,71,143,123,23,232,24,15,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
