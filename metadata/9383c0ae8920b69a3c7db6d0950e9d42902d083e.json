FixTunes will automatically download song information from an online database so you don't have to type anything. If you prefer the hands-on approach, FixTunes makes manually updating your songs easy as well. You can type in the information you want directly or you can search the music database from within the FixTunes program. Searching the database makes it easy to browse directly to the correct artist / album / song combination - even if you aren't sure what they are supposed to be. FixTunes will read and save both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags to your MP3 song files - including artist, album, title, track, year genre, comments and album cover art. Download\n  \nAlbum Cover Art\nFixTunes will automatically download the album cover art images for your songs from the Internet and add them to your files. Many music programs (including iTunes) will display the album cover art image of the currently playing song if the image has been saved inside the file's ID3 tags. In addition to the traditional &quot;list&quot; view of your music library, FixTunes allows you to browse your music by album cover. Album art is organized by Artist, Genre or Year allowing you to quickly scan your music collection. Download\n  \nRename and Organize Your Music Library\nUsing FixTunes, you can easily organize thousands of music files into folders on your hard drive. FixTunes will ask you how you want your files names (for example: &quot;Artist Name - Song Title (Track Number).mp3&quot; and what type of folder structure you want to organize the files into (for example: &quot;Music Folder  Artist Name  Album  file&quot;). All you have to do is answer a few questions and FixTunes takes care of the rest. FixTunes will also detect duplicate files and move the duplicate with the lower file size to a special duplicates directory that you can go through at your leisure. Download\n  \nAutomated Organization\nHow long would it take you to manually go through all of your music and type in the correct information? With FixTunes, your entire music collection can be fixed and organized with just a few clicks. Here's how it works:\nStep 1: FixTunes scans your computer / music folder(s) and finds your music files.\nStep 2: With two clicks, you tell FixTunes to begin looking the correct information for your music files from the online database.\nStep 3: Once the correct information has been downloaded, you simply tell FixTunes (with one click) to fix and organize your music files. The correct information is added, album art is downloaded, folders are created and organized, duplicates are removed and files are rename - all while you do something else (like sleep...).\nDownload\n  \nOnline Catalog Information\nIn addition to the correct tag data, FixTunes also downloads additional information about your songs and albums. From within the program, you have one-click access to a variety of sources including Google searches, Amazon.com catalog information, artist biographical information from Wikipedia and Amazon.com similar albums lists. FixTunes will also display details on the current album directly in the programs interface: Artist, label, year, genres and track listings (so you can easily see which tracks you have and which you don't). Download\n  \nSearch Your Music\nFixTunes makes every part of the library editing experience easy. There is always a search field visible on the program that will display search results of your music files as you type. You can quickly find the songs you are looking for and edit their information, view catalog data or album art all within the same window. Download\nMusic Database\nThe power behind FixTunes is a huge music database with information on over 4 million songs, albums and artists. FixTunes uses this database to look up the missing information in your songs (using the existing information) so you don't have to type it in. The database links to other music sources on the Internet, allowing FixTunes to download album art for your songs and give you one-click access to artist bios and additional catalog information. Download\nEasy to Use\nFixTunes is easy to use. Most FixTunes users have multiple thousands of songs in their collections, and this program was built specifically for them. All actions, from browsing and searching for a specific song, to quickly editing details of multiple songs at a time is all performed in the main program - no extra windows are opened. Menu items and buttons are clearly labeled and do what you would expect them to. You will think FixTunes was designed just for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9383c0ae8920b69a3c7db6d0950e9d42902d083e","amp;dn":"Fixtunes+with+crack+%3A%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9383c0ae8920b69a3c7db6d0950e9d42902d083e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,131,192,174,137,32,182,154,60,125,182,208,149,14,157,66,144,45,8,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
