Carter and Ralph Stanley were Bill Monroe's first rivals in the 1940s. By the 1950s, their version of bluegrass was honed to razor-sharp perfection, and their 46 recordings for the Mercury label are among the high watermarks of classic bluegrass (even Ralph Stanley considers them their best work). Working with a variety of fine supporting players, among them fiddler Art Stamper and mandolinst Bill Napier, the Stanley Brothers vocal artistry (as well as Ralph's hard-hitting banjo picking) never sounded better. This collection of the complete Stanley Mercury recordings offers a previously unissued gem, A Lonesome Night, as well as others (among them Close By) previously available only on Japanese reissues of the 1970s. Gary Reid's authoritative notes frame the picture painted by the music, and two 1959 recordings for the Blue Ridge label round off a remarkable set.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b1370b74e859b32f1e54e2c50516a65faa8a28","amp;dn":"The+Stanley+Brothers+%26amp%3B+The+Clinch+Mountain+Boys+1953-58+%26amp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b1370b74e859b32f1e54e2c50516a65faa8a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,177,55,11,116,232,89,179,47,30,84,226,197,5,22,166,95,170,138,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
