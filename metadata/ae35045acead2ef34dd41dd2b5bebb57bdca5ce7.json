There were 78 episodes produced.\n\nThe show's strength was stories from famous writers of the two genres, including Robert Lewis Stevenson, Victor Hugo, Edgar Alan Poe and even Charles Dickens. Most all of the stories came from the Victorian era or older.\n\nThe show obviously had a low production budget: though the show was aided by selections from famous book authors, it lacked recognizable voice actors. Produced from facilities in New York City, the show drew upon the acting talent there.\n\nOne of the more unusual aspects of the show was that there was no music, other than between scenes. Some have claimed that this lack of music helps to keep the show from being 'dated' and it remains fresh to this day.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFormat: ZIP\n\nSize: 555.3 MB\n\nName:  OTRR_Certified_Weird_Circle_Ver1_CD_1of1.zip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae35045acead2ef34dd41dd2b5bebb57bdca5ce7","amp;dn":"The+Weird+Circle+%28OTRR+Certified+Complete+V1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae35045acead2ef34dd41dd2b5bebb57bdca5ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,53,4,90,206,173,46,243,77,212,29,210,181,190,187,87,189,202,92,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
