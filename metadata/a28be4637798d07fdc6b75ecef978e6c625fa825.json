Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years - and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28be4637798d07fdc6b75ecef978e6c625fa825","amp;dn":"Robocop+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a28be4637798d07fdc6b75ecef978e6c625fa825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,139,228,99,119,152,208,127,220,107,117,236,239,151,142,108,98,95,168,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
