Please remember that you should own the original text books so that the our fellow Doctors who worked so hard at writing them can get the percentage they earned. Just remember two things:\n-In the end experience in the hospital surpasses all guides.\n-Dont count on the dosages being always correct :P\nBTW. These can be used on palm or Pocket PCs. PPCs require a reader such as iSilo to read them. Just google it or something. There is a registration fee. A few dollars wont kill you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc3aeee5423917b50beba48f6a92c437b356bcc","amp;dn":"Medical+Texts+and+GUides+in+PDB+format+for+PDAs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc3aeee5423917b50beba48f6a92c437b356bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,195,174,238,84,35,145,123,80,190,186,72,246,169,44,67,123,53,107,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
