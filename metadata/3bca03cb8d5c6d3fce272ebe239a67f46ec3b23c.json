Nastos \nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/sound-is-mw0000808582\r\n\r\nRob Mazurek is far removed from any standardized progressive or contemporary\r\njazz, preferring to play his cornet and electronics in modern creative modes\r\nbeholden to nothing specific. His big-band, Brazilian-based, or small-combo\r\nrecordings all sport a singularity that assures constant surprises along the\r\npath. This quintet of young and experienced fellow Chicago underground pioneers\r\nis yet another unique project in Mazurek's growing and original\r\ndiscography. Though the band prefers no static time signatures, an odd meter,\r\nfunky, or rock beat creeps in occasionally amidst the space-derived or techno\r\nbackdrop he always includes. Vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz is a shimmering\r\nlight in darkness, Josh Abrams and Matthew Lux shade mixed colors with deft\r\nbass tones, acoustic and electric, respectively. This allows Mazurek to explore\r\nthe full aural spectrum on his orotund toned cornet, occasional synthesizer or\r\npiano. All of these diverse elements can be heard right off the bat for &quot;As If\r\nan Angel Fell from the Sky,&quot; as whirring, minimalist sonics and the spare vibe\r\nwork of Adasiewicz builds somewhat out of an established vacancy. Mazurek\r\nhimself is at his height of interaction with the ensemble during the modal 6/8\r\njam &quot;The Earthquake Tree,&quot; a rolling wheel of hip cornet discourse with\r\nAdasiewicz laying low in the background. Also in the spontaneous composition\r\nmode and a similar beat, &quot;The Hill&quot; is a heavy water experiment based in\r\nrounded edged phrases that linger in Mazurek's head. His fascination with\r\nBrazilian music crops up during the funky and basic tune &quot;Cinnamon Tree,&quot; a\r\nmelodic work very reminiscent of the dancing sounds of Don Cherry. &quot;The\r\nLightning Field&quot; interjects free bop, &quot;Dream Rocker&quot; is exactly as the title\r\nsuggests, and the contemporary &quot;The Field&quot; is led by the vibraphonist, the\r\nbassists, and drummer, with Mazurek as an observer. As sonically arresting as\r\nthe electronic-based pieces like the macabre &quot;Le Baiser/The Kiss&quot; and the\r\nfractured, circular to minimalist space theme &quot;Beauty Wolf&quot; are, they still are\r\nnot the centerpieces or the command performances. &quot;Dragon Kites&quot; is a floating\r\ncomposition trumped by a purposely stuck skip phrase, while furious cacophony\r\nfrom the entire quintet is captured on &quot;Aphrodite Rising,&quot; and &quot;The Star\r\nSplitter&quot; lays Christmas bells on top of South Side Chicago blues. The\r\nremarkable diversity displayed and stunning modernism heard on Sound Is should\r\nindicate that Rob Mazurek's musical footprint is difficult to pigeonhole, but\r\nis clearly an individual stance unique unto itself. If you are open minded,\r\nthis CD is hard to resist.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Stef \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2009/05/rob-mazurek-sound-is-delmark-2009.html\r\n\r\nBy Adam Strohm \nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/4866\r\n\r\nBy Troy Collins \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/sound-is-rob-mazurek-delmark-records-review-by-troy-collins.php\r\n\r\nBy Chris Jones \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/vq3n\r\n\r\nBy Marek Dusza (pl) \nhttp://audio.com.pl/muzyka/recenzje/jazz/16683-rob-mazurek-quintet-sound-is\r\n\r\nBy Joachim Ceulemans (nl) \nhttp://www.kwadratuur.be/cdbesprekingen/detail/rob_mazurek_quintet_-_sound_is/\r\n\r\nDa Luca Canini (it) \nhttp://zerozerojazz.it/rob-mazurek-progetti/214.html\r\n\r\nPar Julien Gros-Burdet (fr) \nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Rob-Mazurek-Quintet.html\r\n\r\nPor Ilse FarÃ­as A.
