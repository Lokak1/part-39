Even a nebulous genre like post-hardcore that was initially so diverse can become formulaic given enough time. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so refreshing when a band comes along thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to mix it up, as is the case with Letlive and their third album, Fake History. Originally released in 2010 on Tragic Hero and reissued (with a few bonus tracks) in 2011 on Epitaph, the album shows that Letlive are easily able to break away from the rest of the pack with an album thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both frantic and sprawling. Not content to just stick to the tried and true formula of verse/chorus/breakdown/repeat, Fake History evokes the meandering prog rock of At the Drive-In, sprinkling the album with enough twists and turns to keep things from getting stale without ever getting lost inside their own heads and losing themselves in an cloud of swirling, esoteric riffage. This kind of focus allows Letlive to strike an enjoyable balance in songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enemies (Enemigos)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Homeless Jazz,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where heaviness and headiness coexist rather than collide, giving the songs a flow thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more rolling hills than peaks and valleys. So nice it had to be released twice, Fake History is an album that really cements Letlive's place in the vanguard of the current crop of modern post-hardcore, making for an album that will not only please longtime fans, but could also pique the interest of some of the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disenfranchised old guard.\n\n  Artist Bio\n\n  Based out of Los Angeles, post-hardcore quintet Letlive formed in 2002. With a frantic, driving sound, the band fuses some of the technical fury of At the Drive-In with a more direct, passionate delivery. The band made its debut in 2004 with Exhaustion, Saltwater, and Everything in Between, released on At One Records. They followed up quickly the next year, releasing Speak Like You Talk, all the while slowly building up their credentials. During these years, the band had a bit of a rotating lineup of members, which finally firmed up in 2009 with a roster consisting of singer Jason Aalon Butler (the group's only founding member), guitarists Jean Nascimento and Jeff Sahyoun, drummer Anthony Rivera, and bassist Ryan Jay Johnson. That year, Letlive signed on with Tragic Hero, which released their third album, Fake History, in 2010. Shortly afterwards, the group made the jump to punk giant Epitaph, which reissued Fake History in 2011 with a handful of bonus tracks. This album was seen as something of a breakthrough for the band in certain circles, and their audience grew, based in large part to their increasingly explosive live shows. They followed up in 2013 with fourth album The Blackest Beautiful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e877f0078c9076d586582ffa64a5971f9d34097b","amp;dn":"Letlive+-+Fake+History+%28EU%29+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e877f0078c9076d586582ffa64a5971f9d34097b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,119,240,7,140,144,118,213,134,88,47,250,100,165,151,31,157,52,9,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
