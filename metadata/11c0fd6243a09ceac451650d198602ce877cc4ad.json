While collecting versions of \\&quot;MacArthur Park\\&quot; and \\&quot;Number of the Beast,\\&quot; I also try to pick up any/all versions of the Super Mario music that I can. After hearing a particularly moving version on NPR the other day, I decided to finally gather all of the versions I\\'d collected over the years and put \\'em together into one torrent file. These range from 8-bit classics to lush orchestrations to cheesy rap to avant-garde productions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c0fd6243a09ceac451650d198602ce877cc4ad","amp;dn":"Super+Mario+-+The+Soundtrack+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c0fd6243a09ceac451650d198602ce877cc4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,192,253,98,67,160,156,234,196,81,101,13,25,134,2,206,135,124,196,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
