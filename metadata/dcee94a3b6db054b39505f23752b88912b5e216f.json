In this realistic medical simulation game, you examine, test, diagnose, and treat 50 different patients, with complaints ranging from premature labor and hallucinations to multiple stab wounds. Every decision is critical. Make the right moves, and you can become chief of staff. Fail, and your career will be as dead as your patients.\n\nUse more than 50 medical tools and tests to examine and treat your patients. Perform simple surgery, watch over a pregnancy, treat sports injuries, and more. Interact with 50 patients and a skilled ER staff. Emergency Room 3 will pull on your heartstrings and challenge your mind. It's a great game for anyone, with or without medical training.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nInstallation Instructions\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWindows:\n\n1. Download the ISO.\n2. Either burn it to a CD, or mount it with software like Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive.\n3. Double-click &quot;Install ER3.exe&quot;. If you have the space, choose Full installation (it requires about 600 MB). This way you won't need the disk/ISO every time you play.\n4. Double-click the &quot;Emergency Room 3&quot; shortcut on your desktop.\n\nNote that I was only able to get this working on Windows XP. If you're running something newer, you may need to run this in a virtual machine.\n\n\nMac:\n\nSorry, can't be much help here. The Mac version is on the same disk, but the system requirements say &quot;Mac OS 7.6 or later&quot;. Unless you're running Mac OS 9 or older, you're probably better off running the Windows version in a virtual machine.
