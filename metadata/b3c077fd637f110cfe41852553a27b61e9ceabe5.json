It has\n\ndefault settings added and some hidden packages removed\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Indexes:\n\nWindows 10 Enterprise 2015  \n\n\n\nRelease File: Win10-Enterprise2015-LTSB-N-Privacy-x64-en-US.iso\n\nSize: 2.56 GB\n\nSHA-1: 1283DC6C0F74055A81E32237C827FC7AB74C35BD\n\n\n\nLanguage: en-US (English - United States)\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n-UEFI/Fat32 support\n\n-NetFx3 pre-integrated\n\n-Windows Defender/Telemetry/and OneDrive Setup have been\n\ncompletely removed.\n\n-Some privacy options are in place to prevent all of your\n\nsearches to go straight to Microsoft servers.\n\n-Only index is pre-activated with AutoKMS from MTK 2.6b1\n\nso you don't need to worry about activation.\n\n-No Windows Store or Online Apps*\n\n*Settings app will still ping data to MS. Avoid it if you're\n\nparanoid\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n-Use a USB program such as RUFUS to put this on a 4GB+ USB\n\nFlash drive for boot installs, or burn to dvdr.\n\n-CUSTOMIZE YOUR SETUP OPTIONS DURING OOBE and DISABLE all of\n\nthe PRIVACY OPTIONS - I have no idea which options will\n\nremain in place if you don't do this.\n\n-I also have no idea if online mode will even work with this.\n\nI do not recommend it as Onedrive setup is already removed.\n\n\n\nFinal Notes:\n\n-This is not a 100% block of everything internet. You can still\n\nuse Windows Update, get new drivers, and everything else you\n\ncan normally do.\n\n\n\n-If you want to further block various things, you obviously can\n\ndo so. I personally recommend checking for updates with the\n\ndiag cab file (provided in torrent folder) to hide driver\n\nupdates that you may not want. (graphics, anyone?)\n\n\n\n-There is no way to choose which updates you want to install.\n\nYou either get all or none. If you really want to have a choice\n\nI suggest trying the program: Portable Update\n\n\n\n-If you're REALLY paranoid, I suggest going through Windows\n\nFirewall and disabling all of the advanced outbound rules for\n\nvarious apps and system functionality. Be careful, tho, or\n\nyou might break network functionality, internet, or activator.\n\n\n\n-I recommend running &quot;services.msc&quot; and stopping/disabling\n\n&quot;Security Center&quot; or it will nag you about anti-virus program\n\noccasionally. It can get annoying","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c077fd637f110cfe41852553a27b61e9ceabe5","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Enterprise+2015+-+%5Ben-US%5D+-+%5BWorking%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c077fd637f110cfe41852553a27b61e9ceabe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,192,119,253,99,127,17,12,254,65,133,37,83,162,123,97,233,206,171,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
