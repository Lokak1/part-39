It was filmed by renowned documentary filmmaking team Albert and David Maysles, using footage from their 1964 16mm documentary What's Happening! The Beatles In The USA, and documents the Beatles' U.S. trip as they travel to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami Beach. Footage of the Beatles (often acting irreverently in front of the camera) in hotel rooms makes up the majority of the non-musical portion of the film. The other portion of the film is the Fab Four's live recorded performances on The Ed Sullivan Show, which were not included in the original 1964 release. Everything is shown in chronological order.\n\nFile Name .........................................: The Beatles First U.S Visit - Maysles Brothers.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,129,783,296 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:21:24\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 624x480 (AR: 1.300)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1516 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.202 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\n\n\nEnglish, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese (pt) and Portuguese (br) subtitles.\n\nThanks pcscarpa for the rip\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
