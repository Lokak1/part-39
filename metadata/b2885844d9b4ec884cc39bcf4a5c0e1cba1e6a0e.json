You assume the role of Dr. Simius, an injured scientist trapped on an island. To stop his evil partner, Dr. Kreep, from using a dangerous mind-control technology, Dr. Simius must travel across the island and destroy the remaining mind-control machines. Travel is difficult, though, since he is confined to a wheelchair, and there are a variety of challenging levels in his way. To make it through the levels, Dr. Simius must control a group of monkeys and have them pull levers, climb ropes, press buttons, and perform a wide variety of actions to help him complete his mission.\n\nIt's suitable for those who like side scrollers but are looking for more puzzles and less action. An excellent puzzle platformer for 1-2 players.\n\nThis game is on the list of retired Real Arcade games on the Game House website, so it is no longer for sale, unfortunately.\n\nInstructions:\n\nJust install and play!\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nProcessor: PII 300 or equivalent\nRAM: 32 MB\nHDD Space: 57 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2885844d9b4ec884cc39bcf4a5c0e1cba1e6a0e","amp;dn":"Monkey+Brains+%28Full+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2885844d9b4ec884cc39bcf4a5c0e1cba1e6a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,136,88,68,217,180,236,136,76,195,155,207,74,92,14,28,186,30,106,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
