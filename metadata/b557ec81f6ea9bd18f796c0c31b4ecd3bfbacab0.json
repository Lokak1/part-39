These include \n all front-wheel drive cars and the introduction of pit stops, adding      \n strategy and planning to the frenetic action. Pit stops are taken in the  \n middle third of a BTCC race and the player's viewpoint switches to in-car \n as tyres are changed and repairs are carried out against the clock.&amp;quot;      \n                                                                           \n On the special effects front, TOCA 2 replicates car damage better than    \n ever before: car wings are ripped off, bonnets are crumpled and fly off   \n at speed, and windscreens not only shatter and smash but feature rain     \n splash effects and bug splats.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The roaring sound effects are designed  \n to leave players with a headache from the gritty, realistic noise of      \n engine roars and tyre screeches. Each tyre generates an individual noise  \n against the road surface, which combines to create a totally authentic    \n sound. A drum and bass soundtrack complements the effect perfectly.&amp;quot;      \n                                                                           \n Features                                                                  \n ~~~~~~~~                                                                  \n                                                                           \n ~ Official BTCC CARS and Support Cars.                                    \n                                                                           \n ~ Full Championship, Arcade Style Challenge, Time Trial, Single Race,     \n   Support Car Championship.                                               \n                                                                           \n ~ Hi-res graphics, remodelled tracks and real-time lighting for maximum   \n   authenticity.                                                           \n                                                                           \n ~ Real pit stops, car set-up options and weather that changes during the  \n   race, all give added depth and strategy.                                \n                                                                           \n ~ Multiple difficulty levels to give accessibility to newcomers and to    \n   challenge experts.                                                      \n                                                                           \n ~ Particle explosions, smashing glass and spectacular crash damage.       \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n Install:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n ~~~~~~~~\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n Unzip then unrar or use our installer.
