The Government of Earth decided to abondon the planet and search for a new home among the stars. They left behind only a handfull of people and a supercomputer in charge of the restoration effort. To prevent this kind of catastrophe on the new planets, humans have decided to build a series of supercomputers to rule over them. To gain more control over the population all children are born in vitro and then given to selected pairs. A race of advanced humans with psionic abilities called Mu has evolved, and the supercomputers that control humanity want to destroy them. Staying hidden and attempting to rescue as many Mu children as possible before they are discovered and eliminated, the Mu have only one longing - to return to what they see as their promised land, Terra.\n\nThe plot of the series spans a large number of years, jumping ahead multiple times, from Jomy's life on Ataraxia, to the various events on Station E-1077, to Jomy's founding of a Mu colony on a habitable planet, to the humans' invasion of said planet in order to eradicate the perceived threat, and finally to the Mu's return to Terra.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8bc2c5ee9177a10d6bad0c51ce3fcfce4b8c71","amp;dn":"Toward+the+Terra+01-24+%28G_P%29+x264+AAC+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8bc2c5ee9177a10d6bad0c51ce3fcfce4b8c71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,139,194,197,238,145,119,161,13,107,173,12,81,206,63,207,206,75,140,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
