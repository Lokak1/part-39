From the first human footprints on Martian soil to a thriving and self-sustaining colony, Sol 0 imagines a near future using technology that could be available within the next few decades. Make use of minerals and resources across the Martian surface to expand from the first exploratory rover to an independent frontier.\r\n\r\nFrom Chondrite Games, Sol 0 gives players the ultimate chance to take on the challenges inherent in pushing the boundaries of space exploration and habitation. Grow food, extract water, build habitats, generate electricity, evade unpredictable Martian weather, mine natural resources, and construct increasingly complex and sophisticated colony bases","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4295bf1a0c5df13e8df763ce3f729aa9d302d5c7","amp;dn":"Sol+0%3A+Mars+Colonization+v1.04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4295bf1a0c5df13e8df763ce3f729aa9d302d5c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,149,191,26,12,93,241,62,141,247,99,206,63,114,154,169,211,2,213,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
