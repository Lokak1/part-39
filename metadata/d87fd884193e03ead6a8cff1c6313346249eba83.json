A magical voyage through time and space, exploring the history, culture and religions that link East and West: from the Persian Empire of Alexander the Great to the huge Mongolian Empire of Kublai Khan, the destinies of highly developed civilizations intermingled until they converged to take the shape of a Eurasian civilization shared by all of us. Babylon, Persepolis, Ai-Khanoum, Baghdad, RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦are virtually recreated with incomparable realism by computer generated images.\n\n\n              &lt;------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n                   \n\n\nToday, Baghdad is a battered city. But we need to remember that before the ruins, from the 8th to the 13th century, Baghdad had been the capital of a refined civilisation !\n\nOver thousand years ago, Baghdad had been named Madinat al Salam, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« the City of Peace Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» with the ruling Abbassids - named after Caliph &quot;Abu al-Abbas&quot; - who had founded the dynasty. In 749, the Abbassid Caliphat further spread its sphere of influence, reaching from Spain to the borders of China.\n\nAs a protector of ancient knowledge, Baghdad had translated Aristotle, Plato, Euclid. The head of its medical school, Ali Abu Ibn-Sina or Avicenna, a Persian from Bukhara, was also a commentator on AristotleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writings.\n\nBaghdad, city of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« A Thousand and One Nights Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â», was a cultural melting pot where craftsmen, poets and merchants were able to get together through to their common language, Arabic. Baghdad enjoyed a culture of commerce and trade ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ inspired by the Coran - which had been unique for its time: very sophisticated financial transactionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ cheques issued in Baghdad and cashed in Cordoba, Spain, some 4000 kilometres away.\n\nThis side-by-side of different languages, cultures and races turned Baghdad into a cosmopolitan city, a dynamic and colourful metropolis, which had been unequalled at its time. However, after five centuries of grandeur, secure in its comfortable lifestyle and weakened by in-fighting, Baghdad was to collapse all of a sudden. In the 13th century, 12 000 Mongol horsemen under the command of Hulagu-Khan, grandson of Gengis Khan, stormed the city and laid siege to Baghdad and its one million inhabitants, for seventeen days. The event heralded the end of Baghdad as the capital of the Caliphat. The city would never again recapture its intellectual radiance, nor its splendour.\n\n\n\n\nThe Episodes will be uploaded as followed:\n------------------------------------------\n\n1)Alexander The Great Conquers The World\n2)Quest For The Forgotten Alexandria\n3)Ghandhara The Renaissance Of Buddhism\n4)The Romans In China\n5)The Silk Road Unites East And West\n6)Baghdad In The Year 1000\n7)Jerusalem 1227 The Excommunicated Peace\n8)The Mongol Conqueror Kublai KhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Baghdad In The Year 1000\nYear:  2004\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:48:30\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x416\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1970 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 183 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (Multisub Scandinavian) Track 1: Danish \n                                   Track 2: Swedish \n                                   Track 3: Norwegian\n                                   Track 4: Finnish\n \n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External Subtitles Included -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MultiSub Scandianavian  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                              IMPORTANT: READ ME\n                             --------------------\n\nSTEP 1.\n-------\n\nTo be alble to view the subtitles you need to associate the ---&gt;&gt; &quot;Idx file&quot; and Sub file with a viewer program such as DAMN_NFO_Viewer_...  If you dont have it already download it. It is a free software program that allows you to view the subtitles.\n\nInstall it and run it.It will say something like that&quot; Lets see if it runs&quot; when you are done with the installation. Now go to the (nfo, idx,srt or sub) file and open it. Windows will now prompt you and ask if you want to search on the internet to find witch program fits or is working for the the choosed file &quot;srt nfo or sub&quot;. Choose the second option that says i will search program for my own. When done choosing, a list of all so far association programs will come up. Find DAMN_NFO Viewer and click on it.\n\nThe file is now associated with DAMN_NFO Viewer and you will not need to do thoose steps again. That goes for all srt,nfo,sub,idx files. You will have to associate them all four.It is a one time work that gives you the ability to have subtitles on all your movies and be able to open the nfo files.\n\n                            &lt;-----------------------&gt;\n\n**** Another thing thats not to be forgotten is that you have to make sure that your &quot;avi&quot; file=movie..documentary or whatever has the same name as your &quot;srt&quot; file=subtitle.\nEx: Of Men And Penguins.avi =MOVIE.............-------&gt; Of Men And Penguins.srt =Subtitle.****\nNow you are done, have fun watching your movies with subtitles....By default all my documentaries are renamed and adjusted so you dont have to do anything.\n\n\n\nSTEP 2.\n-------\n\nDownload VLC player if you dont have it, also a free software that can be found here ---&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.&lt;/a&gt;    \n\nIt plays almost everything..\nWhen you are done installing it choose the movie/documentary.
