Every night he drowns their screams in drink, on the point of losing his mind. Then one of the ghosts offers Fegan a solution: kill those who engineered their deaths.\n\nFrom the greedy politicians to the corrupt security forces, the street thugs to the complacent bystanders who let it happen, all must pay the price. But when Fegan's vendetta threatens to derail Northern Ireland's peace process and destabilise its fledgling government, old comrades and enemies alike want him gone. The secrets of a dirty war should stay buried: even if its ghosts do not.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Not only one of the finest thriller debuts of the last ten years, but also one of the best Irish novels, in any genre, of recent times.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€John Connolly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff2428b9b4958688340256bce359396c8e3674c","amp;dn":"The+Twelve+%28aka+The+Ghosts+of+Belfast%29+by+Stuart+Neville","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff2428b9b4958688340256bce359396c8e3674c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,242,66,139,155,73,88,104,131,64,37,107,206,53,147,150,200,227,103,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
