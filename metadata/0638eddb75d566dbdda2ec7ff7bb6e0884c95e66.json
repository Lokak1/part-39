It was released October 23, 2007.  This is MP3 format, with a VBR around 230kbps.\n\nTrack List: \n\n1) Barnburner\n2) Predation\n3) Dances With Devils\n4) Adversary\n5) White Nights\n6) Rapture\n7) Deliverance\n8) Rattle Me Bones\n9) The Opposition\n10) Will To Bleed\n11) Old Scratch\n\nThe Agony Scene is a Metalcore band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, whose musical style is a combination of thrash metal and hardcore.\n\nThe band has released three albums, one on Solid State Records, one on Roadrunner Records, and one on Century Media Records. They were also signed to Abacus Records for awhile before it folded.\n\nSince Solid State records is generally considered to be a Christian music label, some people have assumed The Agony Scene to be a Christian band. So the band since moved to a new record label and got a new drummer.The band has since confirmed in an interview with HM magazine that since parting ways with the label, they are not a Christian band and are the farthest thing away from that type of band. On why a band would want to be part of the Christian music scene, the band had this to say: &quot;Why would you? I have no idea! I would never want to be part of the Christian music scene at all. I don?t want to have anything to do with it, honestly. It just absolutely disgusts me. That?s totally cool. Believe whatever you want.&quot;\n\nIn late 2006 the band parted ways with drummer Brent Masters, and invited the newest member Ryan Folden a Spokane, WA based drummer to join the band.\n\nEnjoy and PLEASE SEED!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0638eddb75d566dbdda2ec7ff7bb6e0884c95e66","amp;dn":"The+Agony+Scene+-+Get+Damned+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0638eddb75d566dbdda2ec7ff7bb6e0884c95e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,56,237,219,117,213,102,219,221,162,236,127,247,187,110,8,132,201,94,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
