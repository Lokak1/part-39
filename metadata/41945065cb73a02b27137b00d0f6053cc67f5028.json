Locals love the land's unspoiled beauty. Developers see it as a potential gold mine. When newcomer Hank Cooper learns he's been left an old friend's entire beachfront property, he finds himself with a community's destiny in his hands. Cooper has never been a man to settle in one place, and Thunder Point was supposed to be just another quick stop. But Cooper finds himself getting involved with the town. And with Sarah Dupre, a woman as complicated as she is beautiful. With the whole town watching for his next move, Cooper has to choose between his old life and a place full of new possibilities. A place that just might be home.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41945065cb73a02b27137b00d0f6053cc67f5028","amp;dn":"Robyn+Carr-The+Wanderer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41945065cb73a02b27137b00d0f6053cc67f5028","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,148,80,101,203,115,160,43,39,19,123,0,208,246,5,60,198,127,80,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
