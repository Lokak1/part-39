Their story, produced as a film in 1984, introduces information about Navajo kinship, descent systems, gender and age roles, ecology, philosophy, religion, domestic space, child life, and economics. Visually rich, the documentary shows the widely varied ecological zones of the Navajo territory. It also presents social interaction among clan members and within a variety of environments and seasonal changes. Extended narratives in the Navajo language and performances of Navajo music and rituals bring a vivid aural dimension.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dab0aa6829e40c0ea23367898a356aa695983be","amp;dn":"Seasons+of+a+Navajo+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dab0aa6829e40c0ea23367898a356aa695983be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,171,10,166,130,158,64,192,234,35,54,120,152,163,86,170,105,89,131,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
