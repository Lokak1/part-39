It was written by Robert Riskin, based on the Damon Runyon story Madame la Gimp. The film was directed by Frank Capra.\n\nThe movie was remade as Pocketful of Miracles in 1961, starring Bette Davis and Glenn Ford.\n\nIn the movie, Apple Annie (May Robson) is a street peddler who had sent away her daughter as a young child to be raised in Europe, letting her believe that Annie was a member of New York high society. Now her grown-up daughter Louise (Jean Parker) is engaged to marry Carlos Romero (Barry Norton), a Spanish aristocrat. They are coming for a visit and Annie must somehow maintain the masquerade or the fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s father, the Count (Walter Connolly), will not give his blessing to the marriage. Dave the Dude (Warren William), a superstitious gambler who considers her his good luck charm, is talked into providing a luxury apartment, clothes and a husband, 'Judge' Henry Blake (Guy Kibbee) (a pool hall hustler), to deceive her guests.\n\nIMDB: 7.6/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024240/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024240/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
