Through a series of nuanced readings of key American texts, Daniel Traber expertly traces the ambiguous cultural politics where outlaws confirm mainstream culture, and otherness is re-appropriated and reconfigured as the heart of the national project. A deft and discerning application of recent cultural theory - itself implicated in the romanticization and neutralization of otherness - this book has telling consequences for American and literary studies, as well as for the fields of cultural studies and whiteness studies.&quot;--Nick Mansfield, Macquarie University; Author of Subjectivity: Theories of the Self from Freud to Haraway ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bfb930ffa10a67d6205aaf215665d1de8ff614c","amp;dn":"Whiteness%2C+Otherness%2C+and+the+Individuality+Paradox+-+Traber+%5BNo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bfb930ffa10a67d6205aaf215665d1de8ff614c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,251,147,15,250,16,166,125,98,5,170,242,21,102,93,29,232,255,97,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
