As many of the Bay Area groups -- most notably the Grateful Dead with Workingman's Dead and American Beauty -- had begun to do, the band realigns its sound from the dark psychedelia and proto-prog of its earlier works and into a lighter and earthier country-flavored rock. Marrying Maiden does, however, continue highlighting both the sextet's stellar instrumental proficiencies as well as vocals -- featuring the entire band -- throughout. &quot;Don and Dewey,&quot; the album's opener, is a hot-steppin' spotlight for David LaFlamme's classically trained violin work. Presumably, the tune is an ode to the late-'50s/early-'60s R&amp;B duo of the same name. The track has distinct hints of the concurrent contributions that LaFlamme had been making in an incipient incarnation of Dan Hick &amp; His Hot Licks. It likewise sets the tenor for the remainder of the disc's down-home feel. The cover of folkie Fred Neil's &quot;The Dolphins&quot; is notable for Fred Webb's honky tonk piano fills and LaFlamme's vocals, recalling some of the earliest New Riders of the Purple Sage sides. One of the more solidly unifying factors linking the NRPS and It's a Beautiful Day is the guest appearance by Jerry Garcia, who is featured on two numbers. As he had done on Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young's &quot;Teach Your Children,&quot; Garcia lends a few distinct pedal steel guitar riffs to the perky &quot;It Comes Right Down to You.&quot; The track also features former Charlatan Richard Olsen on, of all things, clarinet. Another sign of the times is the pickin' and grinnin' on the appropriately titled &quot;Hoedown&quot; -- on which Garcia adds some fiery banjo fretwork. \n\n\n\nRelease Date\n 1970 \n\nDuration\n38:31 \n\nGenre:\nPop/Rock\n\n\nStyles:\nAlbum Rock\nFolk-Rock\nPsychedelic Pop\nPsychedelic/Garage\nSubmit Corrections \n\nAlbum Moods\n\nDreamy  Searching  Summery  Freewheeling  Warm  Intimate  Organic  Playful  Reflective  Whimsical  Amiable/Good-Natured  Gentle  Literate  Naive  Trippy  Innocent  Sweet  Quirky  Reserved  \n\n\nThemes\n\nReminiscing  Summer  The Creative Side  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f9c071eb2479e5de7aa751cc8b49b16e48638e","amp;dn":"1970+-It%27s+A+Beautiful+Day+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Marrying+Maiden+LP+24b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f9c071eb2479e5de7aa751cc8b49b16e48638e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,249,192,113,235,36,121,229,222,122,167,81,204,139,73,177,110,72,99,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
