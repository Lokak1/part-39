Why is it legendary? Well, when it first came out it cost around $40. Now it's selling for $100+ on Amazon and eBay. Naturally nobody can afford that so here it is. Pictures of all the text in the book \n\nI went to the library, checked it out, and took pictures of it, so please excuse the poor lighting as I did not have a scanner. Some parts of the book might be hard to read so just zoom in on these jpg files. (I skipped the food pictures, and some of the intro, sorry not sorry)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbe9e655ce75f69ea78fcf482f36dfba8e86a648","amp;dn":"The+Last+Course%3A+The+Desserts+of+Gramercy+Tavern+-+Claudia+Flemi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbe9e655ce75f69ea78fcf482f36dfba8e86a648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,233,230,85,206,117,246,158,167,143,207,72,47,54,223,186,142,134,166,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
