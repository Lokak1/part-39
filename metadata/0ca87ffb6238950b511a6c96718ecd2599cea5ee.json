Charles Kiselyak's A Constant Forge examines the filmmaker's career (from 1959's Shadows to 1984's Love Streams) and amounts to a marvelous, heartfelt love letter by fans, friends, and colleagues.\n\nFew directors elicit such strong emotional responses from audiences as Cassavetes. His films attempt to go beyond the surface of human relationships, prodding and provoking the characters, and, as John hoped, the audience, into self-reflection and change. This is part of what good art always tries to do, but his method of presenting the true fragility of emotions and of man's understanding of himself and his environment, proved far too weighty and touchy a subject for most moviegoers and executives. Luckily his work never required huge amounts of funds, because filming people is much cheaper than filming things or locations. And people, and characters, was all that Cassavetes was interested in.\n\nA Constant Forge is an insightful and quick 3 1/2 hours of the man's own words, film clips, and interviews with loved ones and acquaintances. After a brief look at each of Cassavetes's major directorial works, the film meanders through each phase and aspect of his career, from his early childhood and theater work to teaching acting to writing and directing. His assembled stable of reliable actors, including wife Gena Rowlands, Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara, and Seymour Cassell, are all on hand to provide anecdotes and as much insight as they can to the man they all loved and respected. Falk is especially adept at providing quotes, including that John was &quot;the most fervent man I ever met.&quot;\n\n\nDVDRip\nSoft subtitles on torrent: English, Spanish\n\n\nExternal subtitles:\n\nBrazilian Portuguese &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4781106/a-constant-forge-pb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4781106/a-constant-forge-pb&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPortuguese (Portugal) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4781107/a-constant-forge-pt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4781107/a-constant-forge-pt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector: Charles Kiselyak\n3h 21mn\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346794/\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h08m34s206.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h08m34s206.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h09m03s242.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h09m03s242.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h09m38s71.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h09m38s71.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h10m00s44.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h10m00s44.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h10m27s51.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h10m27s51.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h13m15s197.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/C-vlcsnap-2013-01-21-07h13m15s197.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContainer: MKV\nVÃƒÂ­deo Codec: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nVÃƒÂ­deo Bitrate: 1215 Kbps\nÃƒï¿½udio Codec: MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nÃƒï¿½udio Bitrate: 128\nResolution: 640x480\nAspect Ratio: 1.333\nFrame Rate: 29.970 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca87ffb6238950b511a6c96718ecd2599cea5ee","amp;dn":"A+Constant+Forge+%282000%29+%5BJohn+Cassavetes%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ca87ffb6238950b511a6c96718ecd2599cea5ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,168,127,251,98,56,149,11,81,26,108,150,113,142,205,37,153,206,165,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
