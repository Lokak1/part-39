He tells a comic tale of a \nworking class upbringing, where alphabetti spaghetti \nis a luxury. Micky has come a long way since then, \nthanks to a university education he is now a rare \ndelight - an intellectual cockney. Not bad for the \nboy from Bethnal Green.\n\nHaving been nominated for the prestigious Edinburgh \nComedy Award for best newcomer, his Radio 4 series \nWhat Chance Change? was an instant hit with listeners \nand critics alike.\n\n[Clan]\n\nLookin fae: 100mbit+ eu affils, uk [ph]dtv cappers, retai","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee662d00b8252e0b66f68e567bd093c8070f075","amp;dn":"Micky.Flanagan.The.Out.Out.Tour.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee662d00b8252e0b66f68e567bd093c8070f075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,230,98,208,11,130,82,224,182,111,104,229,103,189,9,60,128,112,240,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
