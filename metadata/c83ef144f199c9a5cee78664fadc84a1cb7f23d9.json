At first it had 5 members and the music was some sort of Crust Punk. But after a while only 3 members were left and the music had transformed into some kind of old school death metal ala 1985-1990.\n\nAfter being sort of a side band for years, and the line-up changing from time to time, the band has now transformed into a fulltime band (with Ekman, SÃƒÂ¶derback and Forsberg still playing in THE RULING CLASS though and StÃƒÂ¥lhammar has other projects going).\n\nAs former members of ABHOTH (Ekman &amp; StÃƒÂ¥lhammar), MACABRE END/GOD MACABRE/UTUMNO (StÃƒÂ¥lhammar) and TRIBULATION/DISSOBER (Forsberg) they are certanly no newcomers when it comes to Old School Death Metal!!\n\nBombs of Hades first real demo was &quot;Apocalipsis Canibal&quot; from 2002 after which they had 4 years break until Jonas StÃƒÂ¥lhammar did the &quot;Meathook Diaries&quot; in 2006 all by himself.\n\nPictured from left to right: Butch Ekman, Magnus Forsberg, P-O SÃƒÂ¶derback, Jonas StÃƒÂ¥lhammar\n\nThey started out playing crust punk, but switched to crusty death metal rather quickly.\n\nParticipated with song &quot;Carnivores&quot; on &quot;Ressurected in Festering Slime&quot; compilation LP released by Soulseller (CD version by Agonia).\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nButch Ekman - Bass\nMagnus Forsberg - Drums\nP-O &quot;Wolfie&quot; SÃƒÂ¶derback - Guitars\nJonas StÃƒÂ¥lhammar - Guitars, Vocals\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nChambers Of Abominations (2010)\nThe Serpent's Redemption (2012)\nAtomic Temples (2014)\n\n\n\nThe Serpent's Redemption (2012)\n\n\n\n01-crawl away and bleed forever\n02-darkness, my soul\n03-burn\n04-the serpent's redemption\n05-forgotten in graves\n06-incubis descending\n07-skull collector\n08-scorched earth\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tBlackened Death Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t89.43 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n9 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c83ef144f199c9a5cee78664fadc84a1cb7f23d9","amp;dn":"+Bombs+Of+Hades+-+The+Serpents+Redemption+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c83ef144f199c9a5cee78664fadc84a1cb7f23d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,62,241,68,241,153,201,165,206,231,134,100,250,220,132,161,203,127,35,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
