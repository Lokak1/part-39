I had to create a Lossless-Torrent, 'cause you can't find anywhere on the net a HQ Release. Enjoy &amp; remember this great band! And don't forget to buy their records. Stay heavy!\n\nRemember Gates Of Ishtar!\n\n\n\nINFOS:\nDemotape is from somewhere out in the WWW (that's why it has only 128 kBit/s)\n\nAll Albums got ripped by myself in ALAC. So they are lossless. Feel free to convert it in any other shitty format. But true Metal-Fans listen to HQ-Music. They are all normalized. I hope u enjoy my release. Remember-  Enjoy Metal only in HQ.\n\nGreetings.\n\nInfos:\nGenre: Melodic Death Metal\nOrigin: Sweden\n\nSeasons Of Frost (Demo) 1995\n\n1. Seasons Of Frost\n2. The Silence\n3.
