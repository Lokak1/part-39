It was now Mid-August which meant he had \nbeen separated from Marsha for more than two months. Two months, and all he had \nto show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone \ncalls. True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to\nLocust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. She would \ndate occasionally, but merely as amusement. She would remain faithful. \n\nBut lately Waldo had begun to worry. He had trouble sleeping at night and when \nhe did, he had horrible dreams. He lay awake at night, tossing and turning \nunderneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he \npictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of \nsome neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion. \nIt was more than the human mind could bear. \n\nVisions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. Daytime fantasies of sexual \nabandon permeated his thoughts. And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how \nshe really was. He, Waldo, alone understood this. He had intuitively grasped \nevery nook and cranny of her psyche. He had made her smile. She needed him, and \nhe wasn't there (Awww...). \n\nThe idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled \nto appear. He'd just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons lawn for a dollar \nfifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from \nMarsha. There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company \nof America inquiring into his awing needs. At least they cared enough to write.\n\nIt was a New York company. You could go anywhere in the mails. Then it struck \nhim. He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,\ntrue, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly simple. He would ship himself \nparcel post, special delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to \npurchase the necessary equipment. He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a \nmedium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build. He judged that \nwith a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes, \nsome water, perhaps some midnight snacks, and it would probably be as good as \ngoing tourist.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly packed and the post \noffice had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. He'd marked the package \n&quot;Fragile&quot;, and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber \ncushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried to picture the look of awe and \nhappiness on Marshas face as she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the \ndeliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. She \nwould kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of \nthis before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne \nup. He landed with a thud in a truck and was off. \n\nMarsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It had been a very rough \nweekend. She had to remember not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about\nit though. After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all, \nit was certainly the way of nature, and even though, no he didn't love her, he \ndid feel an affection for her. And after all, they were grown adults. Oh, what \nBill could teach Waldo - but that seemed many years ago. \n\nSheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen \ndoor and into the kitchen. &quot;Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside.&quot; &quot;Ach, I \nknow what you mean, I feel all icky!&quot; Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton \nrobe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on \nthe kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. &quot;I'm supposed to be \ntaking these salt pills, but,&quot; she wrinkled her nose, &quot;they make me feel like \nthrowing up.&quot; Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd \nseen on television. &quot;God, don't even talk about that.&quot; She got up from the \ntable and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue \nvitamins. &quot;Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,&quot; and then attempted to \ntouch her knees. &quot;I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again.&quot; \n\nShe gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the\ntelephone. &quot;Maybe Bill'll call,&quot; she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on \na cuticle. &quot;After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him.&quot; &quot;I \nknow what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place.&quot; \nShe gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. &quot;The thing is, after a \nwhile, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't \nreally do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know \nwhat I mean.&quot; She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over \nher mouth. &quot;I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while,&quot; here \nshe bent forward in a whisper, &quot;I wanted to!&quot; Now she was laughing very loudly. \n\nIt was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang \nthe doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson \nopened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his \ngreen slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had \ngotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. &quot;What do you \nthink it is?&quot; Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back. \nShe stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living \nroom. &quot;I dunno.&quot;\n\nInside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the \nmuffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down \nthe center of the carton. &quot;Why don't you look at the return address and see who \nit's from?&quot; Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the \nvibrating footsteps. It would be soon.\n\nMarsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. &quot;Ah, god, \nit's from Waldo!&quot; &quot;That schmuck!&quot; said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation. \n&quot;Well, you might as well open it,&quot; said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the \nstaple flap. &quot;Ah sst,&quot; said Marsha, groaning, &quot;he must have nailed it shut.&quot; \nThey tugged on the flap again. &quot;My God, you need a power drill to get this \nthing open!&quot; They pulled again. &quot;You can't get a grip.&quot; They both stood still, \nbreathing heavily. \n\n&quot;Why don't you get a scissor,&quot; said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but \nall she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her \nfather kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when \nshe came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter \nin her hand. &quot;This is the best I could find.&quot; She was very out of breath. \n&quot;Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die.&quot; She sank into a large fluffy couch and \nexhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the \nend of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough \nroom. &quot;God damn this thing!&quot; she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,\n&quot;I got an idea.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; said Marsha. &quot;Just watch,&quot; said Sheila, touching her \nfinger to her head.\n\nInside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could \nbarely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his \nheart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and \nwalked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her \nknees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the \nlong blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through \nthe cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of \nWaldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red \nto pulsate gently in the morning sun.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a12f54c5ef08023cf3b564cdd13892466ed831b","amp;dn":"The+Gift","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a12f54c5ef08023cf3b564cdd13892466ed831b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,18,245,76,94,240,128,35,207,59,86,76,221,19,137,36,102,237,131,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
