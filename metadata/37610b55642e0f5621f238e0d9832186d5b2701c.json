He also informs them that due to Madara's lower half still containing Yang-Kurama's as well as both Indra's and Asura's chakras, they fully combined, resulting in his spirit finally emerging. Minato questions Hagoromo on a technique he told them earlier, but he said it would require a huge amount of chakra, which he does not have at the moment, having given Naruto and Sasuke his chakra earlier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37610b55642e0f5621f238e0d9832186d5b2701c","amp;dn":"Naruto+Shippuden+Manga+686+%5BThose+Who+Remain+and+Those+Who+Pass+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37610b55642e0f5621f238e0d9832186d5b2701c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,97,11,85,100,46,15,86,33,242,56,224,217,131,33,134,213,178,112,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
