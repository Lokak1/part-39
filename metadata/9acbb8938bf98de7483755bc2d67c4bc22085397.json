He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the William Dean Howells Medal, the American Book Award, the LÃƒÂ©gion dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Honneur, and the Witness to Justice Award from the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation.\n\nFor much of his career, Styron was best known for his novels, including LIE DOWN IN DARKNESS (1951), his acclaimed first novel, published at age 26; THE CONFESSIONS OF NAT TURNER (1967), narrated by Nat Turner, the leader of an 1831 Virginia slave revolt; and SOPHIE'S CHOICE (1979), a story told through the eyes of a young aspiring writer from the South, about a Polish Catholic survivor of Auschwitz and her brilliant but troubled Jewish lover in postwar Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1985, he suffered his most serious bout with depression, out of which he was later able to write the bestselling memoir DARKNESS VISIBLEÃ‚Â (1990), the work Styron arguably became best known for during the last two decades of his life.\n\n\nWith the exception noted below, all books are in EPUB format:\n\n* THE CONFESSIONS OF NAT TURNER (Random House, 1967)\n\n* DARKNESS VISIBLE: A Memoir of Madness (Random House, 1990)\n\n* LETTERS TO MY FATHER [James L.W.
