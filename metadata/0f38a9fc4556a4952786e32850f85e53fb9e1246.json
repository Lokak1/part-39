Their marriage spanned 35 years until June&amp;#039;s death in May 2003. Rosanne Cash, June&amp;#039;s stepdaughter, once stated that &quot;if being a wife were a corporation, June would have been a CEO. It was her most treasured role.&quot; Roseanne also remembers that June loved flowers and often wore flowered things, and kept them all around her house.\n\nJune and Johnny had one child, John Carter Cash, who was born in 1970.\n\nIn 1967, she and Cash won a Grammy Award in the Best Country &amp; Western Performance, Duet, Trio Or Group (vocal or instrumental) category for the song &quot;Jackson.&quot; In 1970, they won again in the Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal category for the song, &quot;If I Were a Carpenter.&quot;\n------------------\n\nProduct Details\n    * Audio CD (February 21, 2006)\n    * Original Release Date: February 21, 2006\n    * Number of Discs: 1\n    * Format: Original recording remastered\n    * Label: Sony\n\n1.
