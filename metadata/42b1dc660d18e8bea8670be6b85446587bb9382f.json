We bridge this gap, by providing reviews on career and courses, advisories, exam information, rankings and more in a friendly tone. The information we provide is based on in-depth research and backed by authenticated data. Careers360 wants to evolve as the most trusted career councilor to the youth and our only loyalty is to our readers.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b1dc660d18e8bea8670be6b85446587bb9382f","amp;dn":"Careers+360+-+August+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b1dc660d18e8bea8670be6b85446587bb9382f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,177,220,102,13,24,232,190,168,103,11,230,184,84,70,88,123,185,56,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
