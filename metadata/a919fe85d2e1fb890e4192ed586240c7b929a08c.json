The principles Sun-tzu expounded were utilized brilliantly by such great Asian war leaders as Mao Tse-tung, Giap, and Yamamoto. First translated two hundred years ago by a French missionary, Sun-tzuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Art of War has been credited with influencing Napoleon, the German General Staff, and even the planning for Desert Storm. Many Japanese companies make this book required reading for their key executives. And increasingly, Western businesspeople and others are turning to the Art of War for inspiration and advice on how to succeed in competitive situations of all kinds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a919fe85d2e1fb890e4192ed586240c7b929a08c","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+War+-+by+Sun+Tzu.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a919fe85d2e1fb890e4192ed586240c7b929a08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,25,254,133,210,225,251,137,14,65,146,237,88,98,64,199,185,41,160,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
