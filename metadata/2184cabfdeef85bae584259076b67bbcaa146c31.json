You find, download, archive, and organize all your articles within a single application.\n\nBut that is just the start, using spotlight you instantly find back the paper you are looking for. Read it fullscreen, add your notes, send a copy to a colleague. These are just a few of the many features that after using them yourself you will never want to give up again.\n\nDo you also have dozens of PDF files from your favorite scientific articles scattered in the form of PDF files on your harddrive? Do you also try to desperately archive them by renaming and organizing them in folders?\n\nBut like the piles of printed articles on your desk, you can't keep up with all the new papers you download and despite all your efforts it has become impossible to find that one article back.\nFinally that all belongs to the past now. We've been there, trust us, we know. That's why we wrote Papers, our latest application exclusively for the Mac. Papers will revolutionize the way you deal with scientific papers.\n\nSearch for papers using PubMed, directly retrieve and archive PDFs, and read and study them all from within Papers, your personal library of Science.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nPapers for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and above Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·\nPapers ships as a Universal binary for PowerPC and Intel Macs Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· We recommend at least a 1.5 Ghz G4 processor or better.\nBuilt-in search engines require an active internet connection.\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2184cabfdeef85bae584259076b67bbcaa146c31","amp;dn":"Papers+1.9.3+with+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2184cabfdeef85bae584259076b67bbcaa146c31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,132,202,191,222,239,133,186,229,132,37,144,118,182,123,188,170,20,108,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
