I myself spent 11 years consumed by this affliction. I have been 100% drug free since 10/21/11 and currently work in treatment. A lot of the lyrics in my music are about overcoming addiction, and some of the harsh realities that addicts face. I intend to spread a message that recovery from addiction is possible and show that by staying clean it is possible to pursue lost dreams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e519452a0c851c886e38dfa1e2fbb06690cc24d","amp;dn":"TRU+-+A+New+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e519452a0c851c886e38dfa1e2fbb06690cc24d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,81,148,82,160,200,81,200,134,227,141,250,30,47,187,6,105,12,194,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
