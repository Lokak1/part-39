Sheriff\n\n\n\nAbout this course::\n\nA lunar eclipse is a relatively common astronomical event that always brings out the cameras and the long telephoto lenses But the next time a lunar eclipse comes around, go beyond just taking a close-up of a darkened moon. Create a composite that shows the phases of the eclipse and better still, shows the composite in the context of the landscape underneath it That's what photographer and educator Se n Duggan did, and in this course, he deconstructs his photographic steps and post-processing procedures.\n\nThe course begins with advice on how to plan and photograph the eclipse, with the right gear, the right focusing techniques, and the right exposure. Next, Se n evaluates the images in Lightroom and then dives into Photoshop and shows how to composite each image into a finished photo. Along the way, he explores blend modes, layer masking, and other compositing techniques.\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction\n\n2.Planning and Preparation\n\n3.On Location Shooting the Eclipse\n\n4.Processing the Moon Shots\n\n5.Processing the Foreground Landscape Image\n\n6.Adding the Moon Sequence to the Landscape\n\n7.Conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b8369b47d1738c79c0b118a27e8d8e0dbe2ec7","amp;dn":"%5BLynda%5D+Photographing+and+Assembling+a+Lunar+Eclipse+Composite+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b8369b47d1738c79c0b118a27e8d8e0dbe2ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,184,54,155,71,209,115,140,121,192,177,24,162,126,141,142,13,190,46,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
