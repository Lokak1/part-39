If I Could Set You Free\n\nA first time CD reissue for the complete ABC masters of this highly rated cult favorite. You may not know the name, but you will certainly know the sound, as Mac was responsible for the guitar sound that will always be associated with J.J. Cale's classic albums.\nSinger-songwriter Gayden evolved from being one of the best pop songwriters in 1960s Nashville (co-writing the hit Everlasting Love) to a consummate performer of his own uniquely introspective material . Along the way he helped to found the much-feted Area Code 615 and Barefoot Jerry, invent a particular hybrid of slide and wah-wah guitar called the 'SlideWah' and, oh yes, he played on Bob Dylan's Blonde On Blonde, too. He came close to a UK hit with Morning Glory in 1975, but nevertheless he remains largely unknown outside collector's circles and those who know their Nashville non-Country music.\n\nThe two albums featured here, plus the non-album bonus track Sunfall, are part of the chain that links American Southern Rock with the contemporary strand of Country that's known as Americana. Out of print for three decades, they are much treasured vinyl items for those lucky enough to own copies.\n\nAce's CD release of this wonderful music will appeal to Mac's hardcore devotees, as well as hopefully bringing new fans and admirers to the table, in the way that Big Beat's Bob Lind and P F Sloan reissues seem to be doing...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b361cc73592a967bc15add1d6d1062461c32ebc","amp;dn":"Mac+Gayden+-+Skyboat+%2F+Hymn+To+The+Seeker+%5B2008%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b361cc73592a967bc15add1d6d1062461c32ebc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,54,28,199,53,146,169,103,188,21,173,209,214,209,6,36,97,195,46,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
