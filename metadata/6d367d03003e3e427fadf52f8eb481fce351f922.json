With Giovanni Bellini, renowned art historian Oskar BÃƒÂ¤tschmann charts the fraught trajectory of BelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, highlighting the crucial works that established his far-reaching influence in the Renaissance. \nThe artist struggled to break out of the long shadow cast by his accomplished father Jacopo and father-in-law Andrea Mantegna, and BÃƒÂ¤tschmann chronicles BelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development of distinct aesthetic and painting techniques that enabled him to set himself apart. Bellini also insisted on choosing his own subjects and themes, independent of the preferences of his patron Isabella dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Este, and thus set new standards for the role of the artist.\nAnchoring the analysis are a wealth of vibrant color reproductions that include such famous works as The Feast of the Gods and Madonna and Child, as well as photographs of BelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lauded altar-pieces at the churches of San Giobbe, Murano, and San Zaccania. Drawing on these masterpieces, BÃƒÂ¤tschmann argues that BelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artistry and skillful blending of colors created a new aesthetic more akin to music than to previous approaches to painting. And by leading viewers to understand this subtle, refined sensibility, Bellini transformed them into knowledgeable admirers of art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d367d03003e3e427fadf52f8eb481fce351f922","amp;dn":"Giovanni+Bellini+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d367d03003e3e427fadf52f8eb481fce351f922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,54,125,3,0,62,62,66,127,173,245,47,142,180,129,252,227,81,249,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
