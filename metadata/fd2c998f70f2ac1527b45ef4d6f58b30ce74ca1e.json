From his production work with Elvis Costello to writing hit songs like &quot;What's So Funny (About Peace, Love and Understanding)&quot; and &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot; to his iconic albums like Jesus of Cool, Lowe has had a wide ranging career.\n\nIn recent years the Englishman's work has shifted focus placing him more as a balladeer than a rocker. &quot;Lowe has found a new forte in wise, understated and darkly funny musings on the inevitability of romantic ruin,&quot; wrote the New York Daily News. In 2001, he released The Convincer, seen by many as one of the highlights of a long and illustrious recording career. Mojo wrote, &quot;Nick Lowe has made the album of his career, a dozen stories of love and loss so beautifully simple that you'll never get to the bottom of them.&quot;\n\nThen Lowe took a six year break from studio recording before releasing 2007's At My Age. &quot;It's a record that I never really started,&quot; Lowe said. &quot;What normally happens in recent years when I feel like I want to do a record is I get an idea or feeling, along with about three or four new songs. Those songs will serve as sort of the engine that will drive the writing and recording of the rest of the record. But that process never happened with this one.&quot;\n\nOnce he got started, Lowe created what is &quot;probably his most personally revealing work yet&quot; (Now).  At My Age is a &quot;finely honed collection&quot; (Entertainment Weekly) of &quot;Ray Charles-like country soul, smoky late-night jazz, lush Western swing, and even a bit of Rockpile-style rockabilly&quot; (Boston Globe). The Onion AV Club wrote, &quot;There's a real person writing and singing these songs, with a lifetime's worth of joys and disappointments, as well as the wisdom to keep it all in proper balance.&quot;\n\nRecorded: October 9, 2008\n\n    * When I Write the Book\n    * All Men Are Liars\n    * I Trained Her to Love Me\n    * I Read a Lot\n    * Rome Wasn't Built in a Day\n    * Peace, Love and Understanding\n    * Beast in Me\n\nTHE SWELL SEASON\n\nFrom the ACL Taping Program on September 28,2008:\nGrammy recipients have appeared on Austin City Limits numerous times; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a rare thing for Oscar winners to grace the stage in studio 6A. But that is indeed the case as we welcome Glen Hansard and Marketa IrglovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, also known as the Swell Season.\n\nAfter appearing in the film The Commitments, the Irish-born Hansard assembled his long-running band the Frames, who have released half a dozen albums since 1990. Encouraged by her father, the Czech-born IrglovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ started playing piano and guitar as a child. The pair met in ValaÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡skÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© MezÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­Ãƒâ€¦Ã‹â€ Ãƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­, collaborating on the 2006 album named after one of HansardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favorite novels (and from which they took their name). The duo starred in the indie film Once, in which they played struggling musicians; both celluloid and CD soundtrack brought further acclaim. Then the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFalling SlowlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ found on both Once and The Swell Season ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was nominated for and ultimately won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, bringing wider attention to the pairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lovely, finely crafted music. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re happy to be part of their careerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s upward swing. Please join us in welcoming the debut ACL performance of the Swell Season.\n\nRecorded: September 28,2008\n\n    * Lies\n    * When Your Mind's Made Up\n    * Falling Slowly\n    * Low Rising\n    * If You Want Me\n    * Life in Vain (with Daniel Johnston)\n\naired: January 31, 2009\nsource: ATSC 1080i\nvideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 29.97fps\naudio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo\nlanguage: english\nsubtitles: none\nruntime: 55:28\nsize: 1492MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2c998f70f2ac1527b45ef4d6f58b30ce74ca1e","amp;dn":"Austin+City+Limits-Nick+Lowe-The+Swell+Season-1%2F31%2F09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2c998f70f2ac1527b45ef4d6f58b30ce74ca1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,44,153,143,112,242,172,21,39,180,94,244,214,245,139,48,206,116,202,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
