The Ã¢â‚¬Å“MythusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to which Rosenberg (who was also editor of the Nazi Party newspaper) refers was the concept of blood, which, according to the preface, Ã¢â‚¬Å“unchains the racial world-revolution.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ RosenbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no-hold barred depiction of the history of Christianity earned it the accusation that it was anti-Christian, and that unjustified controversy overshadowed the most interesting sections of the book which deal with the world racial situation and the demand for racially homogenous states as the only method to preserve individual world cultures. Rosenberg was hanged at Nuremberg on charges of Ã¢â‚¬Å“waging wars of aggressionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ even though he had never served in the military, and it is likely that he was hanged purely because of this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ea6e8bb57d48149250a3806437142c904960124","amp;dn":"The+Myth+of+the+20th+Century%3A+An+Evaluation+of+the+Spiritual-Int","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ea6e8bb57d48149250a3806437142c904960124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,166,232,187,87,212,129,73,37,10,56,6,67,113,66,201,4,150,1,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
