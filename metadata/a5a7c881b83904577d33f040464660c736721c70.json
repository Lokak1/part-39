Besides reflecting on the conditions that made possible this recent boom, this book elaborates on the new aesthetic tendencies of recent productions, as well as their relationships to earlier traditions of Brazilian cinema.

After almost being totally destroyed during the early 1990's, Brazilian cinema has experienced a great renaissance. This book covers the full range of this renaissance, with various essays touching on the artistic, political, religious, and socio-economic realities that characterize this movement. Gracing the cover is a still from perhaps the best-known (and best-loved) film of the era, &quot;Central Station&quot; (1998), a movie that is mentioned and discussed frequently in the text. For those interested in expanding their horizons, especially in terms of cinema, this book is an engaging read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a7c881b83904577d33f040464660c736721c70","amp;dn":"The+New+Brazilian+Cinema%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a7c881b83904577d33f040464660c736721c70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,167,200,129,184,57,4,87,125,51,240,64,70,70,96,199,54,114,28,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
