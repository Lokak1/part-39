When the records of the Jagdflieger pilots became available after the war, they were initially greeted with incredulity the highest claim was for 352 kills, and more than 100 pilots had recorded more than 100 victories. However post-war research proved that these claims had in fact been made in good faith and confirmation had only been given after rigorous checking. To discover the secret of this success, aviation history expert Mike Spick examines the exploits of these aces and sets out the context in which it took place. Every major theatre is covered in detail including the conditions peculiar to each: climate, relative numerical and qualitative strengths, the presence or absence of radar and other measures, and the relative merits of the planes being flown. He focuses on the methods and tactics used by individual aces and uses first-hand sources wherever possible to put the reader right alongside the pilot in the cockpit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c46736b837907efdbd0529884bf4a7c98d3ef8","amp;dn":"Luftwaffe+Fighter+Aces+by+Mike+Spick.epub+%7BBD%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c46736b837907efdbd0529884bf4a7c98d3ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,196,103,54,184,55,144,126,253,189,5,41,136,75,244,167,201,141,62,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
