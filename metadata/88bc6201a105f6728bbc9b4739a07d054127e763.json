Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia, a young Hollywood hopeful, had been brutally murdered. Her murder sparked one of the greatest manhunts in California history. In this fictionalized treatment of a real case, Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard, both LA cops obsessed with the Black Dahlia, journey through the seamy side of Hollywood to the core of the dead girl?s twisted life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88bc6201a105f6728bbc9b4739a07d054127e763","amp;dn":"James+Ellroy+-+The+Black+Dahlia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88bc6201a105f6728bbc9b4739a07d054127e763","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,188,98,1,161,5,246,114,139,188,155,71,57,160,125,5,65,39,231,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
