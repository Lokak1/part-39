Groups such as MuzsikÃƒÂ¡s and The Trio Bulgarka performed here and had albums released on British labels. Vujicsics were also part of this mini explosion of interest and Hannibal Records put out this album having licensed the recordings from the legendary Hungaroton label.\n\nVujicsics are an interesting band. Named after the composer and musicologist Tihamer Vujicsics they share his passionate interest in the folk music of the ethnic minorities of southern Hungary. So this is a Hungarian band who are perhaps best known for playing Serbian or Croatian folk music. In the case of this album it is the former musical tradition that provides the material. The six band members play a wide range of stringed and woodwind instruments and are joined by four female singers including MÃƒÂ¡rta SebestyÃƒÂ©n.\n\n\n01 - Dere\n02 - Seljancica\n03 - Da je visjna-Tanac-rance-Vranjanka\n04 - Malo kolo\n05 - Zbogom selo\n06 - Svatovac iz pomaza\n07 - Madarac\n08 - Selom ide-Ovo kolo\n09 - Sviraj zlato!\n10 - Sokacko kolo\n11 - Banatsko kolo-Oj savice-Mimikino kolo\n12 - Aj..., sviralka\n\n\nMihaly Borbely: Clarinet, Flute, Ocarina, Sopile, Tamboura\nMiroslÃƒÂ¡v BrczÃƒÂ¡n: Bass, Cello, Tamboura, Tambura\nDalman Eredics: Bass\nGabor Eredics: Accordion, Concertina, Conductor, Tamboura\nKÃƒÂ¡lmÃƒÂ¡n Eredics: Bass\nErika Frei: Vocals\nMarica Greges: Vocals\nKatalin Gyenis: Vocals\nKaroly Gyori: Tambur, Violin\nZoltÃƒÂ¡n JuhÃƒÂ¡sz: Bagpipes\nMÃƒÂ¡rta SebestyÃƒÂ©n: Vocals\nFerenc SzendrÃƒÂ¶di: Guitar, Tamboura\n\n\nsource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Vujicsics/dp/B000000614/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338633910&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Vujicsics/dp/B000000614/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338633910&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef25e44b07e688c9f3afcd52aac90696075dfcf1","amp;dn":"Vujicsics+-+1991+CD+RIP+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef25e44b07e688c9f3afcd52aac90696075dfcf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,37,228,75,7,230,136,201,243,175,205,82,170,201,6,150,7,93,252,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
