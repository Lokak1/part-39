Unable to deal with the trauma, Dexter makes a drastic decision that will impact everyone around him. Quinn stirs up trouble at the station when he notes that Rita's murder, which is being pinned on the Trinity Killer, doesn't fit his normal murder profile. Things get even more heated when Quinn suggests to LaGuerta that they look at the husband: Dexter Morgan. Meanwhile, Quinn offers Debra much needed support, causing her to see Quinn in a new light.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShould work in most players. I recommend VLC Player (google it), its free.\n\n\nSeed Forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:198435ac4e4e91a1e280cab059f7ed81e7a2e356","amp;dn":"Dexter+Season+5+episode+1+HD+%5BQuad-K%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"198435ac4e4e91a1e280cab059f7ed81e7a2e356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,132,53,172,78,78,145,161,226,128,202,176,89,247,237,129,231,162,227,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
