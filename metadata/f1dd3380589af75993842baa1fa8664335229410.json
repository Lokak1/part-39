Kristina Milnor takes up a series of texts and their contexts in order to explore this paradox. Through an examination of authors such as Vitruvius, Livy, Valerius Maximus, Seneca the Elder, and Columella, she argues that female domesticity was both a principle and a problem for early imperial writers, as they sought to construct a new definition of who and what constituted Roman public life.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;...a fine new study.&quot; Matthew Leigh, Times Literary Supplement\n\n&quot;It reads well...and will fuel many discussions in class and conference.&quot;Classical World\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nKristina Milnor is Assistant Professor of Classics, Barnard College, Columbia University.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1dd3380589af75993842baa1fa8664335229410","amp;dn":"Kristina+Milnor+-+Gender%2C+Domesticity%2C+and+the+Age+of+Augustus+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1dd3380589af75993842baa1fa8664335229410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,221,51,128,88,154,247,89,147,132,43,170,31,168,102,67,53,34,148,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
