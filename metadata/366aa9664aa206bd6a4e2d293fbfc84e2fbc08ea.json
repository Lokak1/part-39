IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen Dylan a few times and when he sings he changes the melodyÃ¢â‚¬â€œ the chords stay the same but the melody is completely different from the original version. Nikola, a good friend of ours from Paris, who passed away a few years ago, loved Bob Dylan. Nikola said when you see Dylan live you have to disengage your way of thinking, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t judge it, and just listen to the song as if it was a totally new piece of art. Yes, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m with Nikola on that.\n \nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar and Vocals\nKevin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\nJason Myers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:366aa9664aa206bd6a4e2d293fbfc84e2fbc08ea","amp;dn":"Buckets+of+Rain+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"366aa9664aa206bd6a4e2d293fbfc84e2fbc08ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,106,169,102,74,162,6,189,106,78,45,41,63,191,200,78,47,188,8,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
