John Hurt plays his conniving rival, an overlooked lord who plots his demise, while Peter O&amp;#039;Toole brings quiet dignity to his role as the King&amp;#039;s private secretary and unofficial guide through the maze of etiquette and diplomacy.\n\n  Starring: John Goodman, Peter O&amp;#039;Toole, John Hurt, Camille Coduri, Richard Griffiths.\n\n  Directed by: David S.
