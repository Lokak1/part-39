It incorporates all aspects of environmental computer modeling including an historical overview of the subject, equations of motion and their approximations, a modern and clear description of numerical methods, and the determination of initial conditions using weather observations (an important new science known as data assimilation).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19a2720de62f103e9cb4fd51b1f4a43c60f7aa0","amp;dn":"%26quot%3BAtmospheric+Modeling%2C+Data+Assimilation+and+Predictability","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19a2720de62f103e9cb4fd51b1f4a43c60f7aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,154,39,32,222,98,241,3,233,203,79,213,27,31,74,67,198,15,122,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
