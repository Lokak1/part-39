The OAI was started by a Thelemic magician named David Cherubim, who was also a founder of the Thelemic Golden Dawn. The meaning of &quot;Antichrist&quot; in it follows on Jack Parson's use of the term, and S. Jason Black's, which in turn derive from Crowley's idea on Babalon and the Beast. \n\n\nOf particular interest are the &quot;Revelations of the Antichrist&quot;, which are books that were received by David Cherubim during workings relating to the OAI\n\nIn 2003, almost twenty years since the first workings that the later OAI was based on, the second in command, Joshua Seraphim, became increasingly erratic and autocratic, was called to resign by Cherubim, then kicked out, then because Seraphim continued to operate the website (albeit now with all his own materials) and wouldn't stop Cherubim put the order to sleep and disassociated himself with anything that Seraphim did. \n\nIncluded also are some of Seraphim's post-getting kicked out documents. \n\nContents:\n\n \nEpistle of the OAI \nLiber Antichristus \nProphecy of the Seven Seals \nThe Three Grades of the OAI \nDiary of the Anti-Christ \na)Manifesto of the Anti-Christ \nb)Introduction \nc)Liber Antichristus \nd)Diary of the Anti-Christ \nThe Book of the Seven Seals: The Revelations of the Anti-Christ \na)The Book of the Antichrist  b)The Book of the Elder Kings  c)The Book of \nthe Palace of the Stars  d)The Book of Quartus Kerub  e)The Book of the Battle of \nConquest  f)The Book of The Hour of Silence  g)The Book of Alkhemi                   \nManifesto of the Anti-Christ                                                                              \nThe archetype of the Anti-Christ                                                                          \nReading List \nLater Seraphim material:  \nBook of Baphomet :                                                                                     \nLitany of enchantment,Canticle of Baphomet, Blasphemy of Baphomet 666 \nChristianity and the Devil  \nThe New World Order Antiquity of the Illuminati  \nTHE EPISTLE OF MALEDICTION  \nNumber of the Beast 666  \nThe Rite of Lilith  \nThe Scarlet Woman and Antichristendom \n                                                          \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65a6e7e3a4db1fd9cb2b0c4aded40993536d3c3b","amp;dn":"O.%5C%27.A.%5C%27.I.%5C%27.+Material%2C+Ordo+Antichristianus+Illuminati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65a6e7e3a4db1fd9cb2b0c4aded40993536d3c3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,166,231,227,164,219,31,217,203,43,12,74,222,212,9,147,83,109,60,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
