EJI researchers documented 3959 racial terror lynchings of African Americans in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia between 1877 and 1950 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least 700 more lynchings of black people in these states than previously reported in the most comprehensive work done on lynching to date.\n\nLynching in America makes the case that lynching of African Americans was terrorism, a widely supported phenomenon used to enforce racial subordination and segregation. Lynchings were violent and public events that traumatized black people throughout the country and were largely tolerated by state and federal officials. This was not Ã¢â‚¬Å“frontier justiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ carried out by a few marginalized vigilantes or extremists. Instead, many African Americans who were never accused of any crime were tortured and murdered in front of picnicking spectators (including elected officials and prominent citizens) for bumping into a white person, or wearing their military uniforms after World War I, or not using the appropriate title when addressing a white person. People who participated in lynchings were celebrated and acted with impunity. Not a single white person was convicted of murder for lynching a black person in America during this period.\n\nThe report explores the ways in which lynching profoundly impacted race relations in this country and shaped the contemporary geographic, political, social, and economic conditions of African Americans. Most importantly, lynching reinforced a narrative of racial difference and a legacy of racial inequality that is readily apparent in our criminal justice system today. Mass incarceration, racially biased capital punishment, excessive sentencing, disproportionate sentencing of racial minorities, and police abuse of people of color reveal problems in American society that were shaped by the terror era.\n\nNo prominent public memorial or monument commemorates the thousands of African Americans who were lynched in America. Lynching in America argues that is a powerful statement about our failure to value the black lives lost in this brutal campaign of racial violence. Research on mass violence, trauma, and transitional justice underscores the urgent need to engage in public conversations about racial history that begin a process of truth and reconciliation in this country.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We cannot heal the deep wounds inflicted during the era of racial terrorism until we tell the truth about it,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said EJI Director Bryan Stevenson. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The geographic, political, economic, and social consequences of decades of terror lynchings can still be seen in many communities today and the damage created by lynching needs to be confronted and discussed. Only then can we meaningfully address the contemporary problems that are lynchingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nLinks here: http://www.eji.org/node/1037\n\n    Lynching in America: Report Summary\n\n    Lynching in America: Supplement - Lynchings of African Americans by County\n\n    EJI Press Release\n\n    New York Times: History of Lynchings in the South Documents Nearly 4,000 Names\n\n    New York Times: Map of 73 Years of Lynchings\n\n    New York Times Editorial: Lynching as Racial Terrorism\n\n    The Guardian: Jim Crow lynchings More Widespread Than First Thought, Report Concludes\n\n    Atlanta Black Star: New Report Compiles A Devastating Count of Nearly 4,000 Lynchings of Black People in the US, Showing This Form of White Terrorism Had Profound Impact on American History\n\n    The Crime Report: 'Confronting the Legacy of Racial TerrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\n    Democracy Now: As Study Finds 4,000 Lynchings in Jim Crow South, Will U.S. Address Legacy of Racial Terrorism?\n\n    EJI audioNPR: New Report Examines Lynchings And Their Legacy In The United States\n\n    Agence France Presse: Southern States Lynched Nearly 4000 Blacks\n\n    Atlanta Journal-Constitution: 'Terror Lynchings' Claimed Nearly 600 Georgia Victims\n\n    Alternet: 5000 African Americans Were Lynched by White Mobs\n\n    Business Insider: There Were Way More Lynchings in America Than Anyone Thought\n\n    Daily Kos: Report on Lynching in the US Shows Historical Numbers, Like Killings by Police, are Underreported\n\n    Daily Mail: Jim Crow Lynchings Were More Common Than Thought with New Report Adding 700 More Murdered African Americans to Total of Nearly 4000\n\n    Gawker: Report: Southern Lynchings Were Worse Than Previously Described\n\n    Global Grind: New Report Reveals 4000 Names of Black People Lynched in Jim Crow South Over 73 Years\n\n    International Business Times: Black History Month 2015: Racial Justice Group Plans To Mark Thousands Of Sites Where Blacks Were Hanged\n\n    The Times-Picayune: 73 Years of Lynchings in the South Inventoried\n\n    The Times-Picayune: 73 Years of Lynchings in the South Inventoried\n\n    The Times-Picayune: 73 Years of Lynchings in the South Inventoried","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:859a299bdf030dafdca6df9e655b2254e1a1fce8","amp;dn":"%5BWhite+ChrisitianTerrorism%5D+Lynching+In+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"859a299bdf030dafdca6df9e655b2254e1a1fce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,154,41,155,223,3,13,175,220,166,223,158,101,91,34,84,225,161,252,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
