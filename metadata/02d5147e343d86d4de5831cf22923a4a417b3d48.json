Inspired by material they composed while performing across Europe, it was recorded over numerous sessions at London's Abbey Road Studios. The album explores themes of absence, the music business, and former band-mate Syd Barrett's mental decline. Early sessions were a difficult and arduous process but it was Roger Waters' idea to split the centrepiece track &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; in two, and join each half with three new compositions. &quot;Shine On&quot; was a tribute to Barrett, who, in an ironic twist, made an impromptu visit to the studio while it was being recorded. The band failed initially to recognise Barrett, who had gained weight and changed in appearance.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Shine on you crazy diamond (parts I-V)               [13:32]\n02.Welcome to the machine                               [07:34]\n03.Have A cigar                                         [05:25]\n04.Wish you were here                                   [05:17]\n05.Shine on you crazy diamond (parts VI-IX)             [12:29]\n____\n\n44:17 min\n 62,8 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d5147e343d86d4de5831cf22923a4a417b3d48","amp;dn":"Pink_Floyd-Wish_You_Were_Here-%28Retail%29-1975-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d5147e343d86d4de5831cf22923a4a417b3d48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,213,20,126,52,61,134,212,222,88,49,207,34,146,58,74,65,123,61,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
