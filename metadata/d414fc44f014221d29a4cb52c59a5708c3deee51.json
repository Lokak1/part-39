He always gets his man. But will he also get his woman (Bernadette Peters) - especially one with an infant in her arms, a quater-million in the trunk of a stolen '59 Caddy and gun-toting goons on her trail?\n\nIn Eastwood's wily hand, Nowak is a master i disguise who becomes a radio DJ, a rodeo clown or a Vegas-style huckster to nail his target. As Nowak's frisky quarry Lou Ann, Peters easily nabs her leading man's heart. Supporting players Geoffery Lewis, William Hickey and future superstar Jim Carrey (briefly seen as a Reno lounge entertainer) also help make this action comedy vehicle a sure-handler.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d414fc44f014221d29a4cb52c59a5708c3deee51","amp;dn":"Pink.Cadillac.1989.DVDRip.XviD-stoffinho17+%28Jim+Carrey%29+MultiSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d414fc44f014221d29a4cb52c59a5708c3deee51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,20,252,68,240,20,34,29,41,164,203,82,197,154,87,8,195,222,238,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
