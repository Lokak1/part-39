With a light and witty exposition of the history and future of consciousness, Thought Forms explains that what you call everyday life - or the &quot;real world&quot; - is actually a specialized form of dreaming: that the world seems real to you only because you've been taught to consider it real, and that you can bring another world of magic and joyfulness into being just by changing what you believe is reality. \n\nCombining teachings from Jungian psychology and shamanism, Thought Forms gives simple yet effective techniques for putting the theory into practice: for reversing your social conditioning, disentangling yourself from the webs of other people, and putting yourself in touch with your true feelings. Although the approach is astrological, no previous knowledge of astrology is required to understand and use the astrological techniques. In fact, the book is a great beginner's introduction to the power and potentials of astrology. Contents include: Astronomical and astrological explanations of personality types defined by MercuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s synodic cycle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ its cycle of phases as it circles the sun, with tables 1900-2050; Discussion of consciousness: what it is; how it arose; and whither it is going, with a new view of the meaning of reincarnation and parallel realities. Detailed instructions in white magic techniques: How to Channel and Banish Thought Forms; Creative Visualization; How to banish Black Magicians and Demons; Use of Nature Spirits.
