Over eight \nweeks they work with an elite team of experts to see if we really can \nlearn to be happier.\n\nEpisode 1:\nThe experiment begins in Marrickville, the heart of an area recently \nidentified by Deakin University's annual wellbeing index as one of the \nunhappiest in Australia. As we meet the eight volunteers, we learn \nthat their happiness levels are way below the national average. The \nteam of experts has just eight weeks to change the volunteers' \nscores, and their lives.\n\nHow will socially phobic Cade cope with the challenge of connecting \nwith strangers at the local mall? Can mindfulness really help \nstressed-out real estate agent, Tony? Will gratitude help father-of-\nfour, Stephen, strike that elusive work-life balance? How can the \nyoungest of the volunteers, Ben, benefit from writing his own \neulogy?\n\nScience claims that happiness is easily within our reach, but how will \nthese scientifically validated techniques play out in the lives of \nordinary Australians? The results are more than startling.\n\n\nYou too can take the happiness test at the accompanying website:\nhttp://makingaustraliahappy.abc.net.au/\n\n\n__ W4F is looking for __\n. 10000mbit+ affil sites (archives a plus)\n.
