Originally intended as an anonymous secret side project for Hayes to experiment with new sounds, the album was given away for free for a limited period via digital download as a gift to fans on Hayes' birthday on 8 May 2009 but all free links have since been removed. The album is an eclectic and experimental vehicle where Hayes adopted various personas and experimented with vocal delivery and genre in a way he had never done as a mainstream artist. It is unique as a recording because Hayes shares vocal duties with Conley, sometimes swapping out the lead for backing vocals. Hayes takes the lead on about half the album at varying times changing his voice, alternating between a high falsetto, a lower raspy tone, experimenting with hip hop and beach boys styled harmonies.\n\n* from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Smug_(album)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e1a747662e55b2f7f5a7f74d17c4c78eea6b0f","amp;dn":"We+Are+Smug+-+We+are+smug+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e1a747662e55b2f7f5a7f74d17c4c78eea6b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,225,167,71,102,46,85,178,247,245,167,247,77,23,196,199,142,234,107,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
