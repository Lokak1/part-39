Though clearly besotted with Joan, Tony was struggling with drink and violent depression.\n\nAfter months of turmoil, Joan gave him a final ultimatum: if he made a go of Australia, if he kept off the booze for a year, she would leave John and marry him.\n\nTony left for Australia determined to win Joan over.
