The album delivers an uplifting message of empowerment, telling us that We Can't Sell Dope Forever thru a splendid array of musical compositions and powerful lyrics. Young Noble from the OutLawz raps There aint too many dope dealers retiring, there aint too many old prostitutes vacationing on the island, instead of knocking 'em down my purpose is to inspire them. With production by, Dead Prez, Soul Messiah, Edi Don and a special guest appearance, by Lazy Bone (Bone Thugs and Harmony) this LP is a certified street banger.
