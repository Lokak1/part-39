Edwards frequently incorporates bits of Canadiana into her songs (hockey, CBC), and tells gorgeous and heartbreaking stories in other tunes. &quot;Alicia Ross&quot; is the song of the year. It describes the last minutes in the life of Alicia Ross from Ross's perspective just before she was tragically murdered by her neighbor in August 2005.When I first heard this song I was immediately captivated by Edwards's strong vocal performance and the graveness of the lyrics. It literally brought tears to my eyes the first few times I heard it, and this was before I knew the heartbreaking story behind the song. Get this album. You won't regret it.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoeramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/09/kathleen-edwards/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/09/kathleen-edwards/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:545b7b767fe91ad5047952120e558f08d285456e","amp;dn":"Kathleen+Edwards...Asking+for+Flowers%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"545b7b767fe91ad5047952120e558f08d285456e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,91,123,118,127,233,26,213,4,121,82,18,14,85,143,8,210,133,69,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
