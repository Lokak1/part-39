But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a skill harder to master.\n\nv1.0 changelog:\nNew Features:\n- Random killhouse generator + over 90 new random house layouts.\n- Over 50 new maps (in campaign, single and random combined).\n- New door types: grating doors / padlocked doors.\n- New item: Bolt Cutter.
