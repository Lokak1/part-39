Our implacable foes ignore all attempts at communication, and they take no prisoners. Our only hope lies with an unlikely coalition: Major Lyle Kaufman, retired warrior; Marbet Grant, the Sensitive whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involved with Kaufman; Amanda, a very confused fourteen-year-old girl; and Magdalena, one of the biggest power brokers in all of human space.\n\nAs the action moves from Earth to Mars to the farthest reaches of known space, with civil unrest back home and alien war in deep space, four humans--armed with little more than an unproven theory--try to enter the FallersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ home star system. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a desperate gamble, and the fate of the entire universe may hang in the balance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fbd6a3ecf085281f47de9e04151a69d96f46cf8","amp;dn":"Nancy+Kress+-+Probability+Space+%28Probability+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fbd6a3ecf085281f47de9e04151a69d96f46cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,189,106,62,207,8,82,129,244,125,233,224,65,81,166,157,150,244,108,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
