That is why Joanne, an art teacher, and I, a language arts teacher,\ncollaborated on this book. We believe that the easy to do activities in this\nbook will help you meet this challenge. In fact, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re excited by the progress\nweÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already seen with students of all learning styles in reading and writing\nskills ranging from poetry to punctuation.\nMaking art clearly benefits students on many levels. First, it gives them the\nchance to learn creatively, literally having a hand in the process. Second,\nartwork engages students by engaging their senses. The colors and design of a\nwell-devised project, the feel and even the smell of the materials, the\nmanipulation of these materials toward a tangible creation, and the inevitable\nfeedback of peers and parents all come together to reach students of all\nlearning styles and strengths. Finally, art making builds studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ confidence\nand self-esteem by offering them the freedom to execute their own ideas,\ndecisions, and evaluationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½without the risk of being wrong. And perhaps\nmost important, it is fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53af4b5be9e28d1172a1967127e34e28f0c12046","amp;dn":"Super+Creative+Language+Arts.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53af4b5be9e28d1172a1967127e34e28f0c12046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,175,75,91,233,226,141,17,114,161,150,113,39,227,78,40,240,193,32,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
