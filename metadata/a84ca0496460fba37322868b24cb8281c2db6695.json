What I do know that is Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth easily holds company with some of the better know heavyweights of Stax Records lore (Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes etc).\n\nSoulful grooves and thought provoking consciencous lyrics are blended together beautifully. Your bound to have heard (although without really having much of an idea that it was from this project) a lot of material on this sampled by some of hip hop giants including Rakim,Dr. Dre &amp; KRS-One.\n\nThis album is a must have for true fans of 70's R&amp;B music.\n\nVery tight, a masterpiece. One of the most sampled albums ever.\n\nMy personal best are the jazzy groover &quot;24 Carat Black Theme&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a killer funky number, with a wonderfully spacey groove and 12.40 minutes Ã¢â‚¬Å“PovertyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ParadiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nDon't Sleep.\n\nTracks\nA1 Synopsis One: In The Ghetto / God Save The World (8:34)\nA2 Poverty's Paradise (12:40)\nA3 Brown-Baggin' (6:45)\nB1 Synopsis Two: Mother's Day (2:04)\nB2 Mother's Day (9:46)\nB3 Foodstamps (6:26)\nB4 Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth (3:41)\nB5 24-Carat Black (Theme) (7:17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84ca0496460fba37322868b24cb8281c2db6695","amp;dn":"24-Carat+Black+-+Ghetto-+Misfortune%27s+Wealth+%281973%29+-+%28V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84ca0496460fba37322868b24cb8281c2db6695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,76,160,73,100,96,251,163,115,34,134,139,36,203,130,129,194,219,102,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
