Lovecraft, Mary Shelly and Bram Stoker, Dan James presents his vision of horror in his latest graphic novel, MOSQUITO. This silent South American folktale is an elegant and strikingly stylistic, wordless Vampire story, presented completely in Red Ink. Intriguing and clever, it follows the adventure of a man who receives a curious letter containing Polariods of vampire victims and a map to the small town where the vampire lives. He gathers his stakes, says goodbye to his children, and walks straight into the mouth of evil.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf4f441ac3859ef902ecebc4160d906e95833c2","amp;dn":"Dan+James+-+Mosquito","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf4f441ac3859ef902ecebc4160d906e95833c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,244,244,65,172,56,89,239,144,46,206,188,65,96,217,6,233,88,51,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
