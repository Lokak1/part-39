In this posthumously published novel (Parker died in January), the Boston PI tries to retrieve a priceless work of art and deals with the rarefied and nasty world of academics, as he did in his very first caper, The Godwulf Manuscript (1973). Thirty-seven novels later, Spenser can still nail a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foibles on first meeting, still whip up a gourmet meal in a few minutes, still dispatch the thugs who haunt his office and his home, and do it all while maintaining a fierce love of Susan Silverman and English poetry (which he quotes frequently and always to good effect). The plot this time spins off from SpenserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shame over the murder of a client, a college art professor who asked him to provide backup during a delicate ransom exchange for a rare seventeenth-century Dutch painting. Spenser, ever true to his modern-day chivalric code, cannot let himself off the hook for the professorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. His investigation unveils the professorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s avocation as a sexual predator of coeds, and it digs deeply into both the world of art theft (reaching back to Nazi thefts of great European works). Halfway through this thoroughly entertaining mystery, Parker writes a perfect valedictory for the much-loved Spenser: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes I slew the dragon and galloped away with the maiden. Sometimes I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. . . . But so far the dragon hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t slain me.&quot;\n\n64kbps VBR.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c7947d99baf76c2083f38b409b5271ebbb64113","amp;dn":"Robert+B.+Parker+-+Painted+Ladies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c7947d99baf76c2083f38b409b5271ebbb64113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,121,71,217,155,175,118,194,8,63,56,180,9,181,39,30,187,182,65,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
