The band was one of the first to combine elements of heavy metal with a hardcore punk base, pioneering a heavier style of hardcore that would become popular in the following decades. Formed in late 1984, the band, stayed together until 1998, surviving numerous lineup changes and shifts in musical style. In October 2004, the band reunited and gave two final farewell shows at New York's CBGB Club.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1df5e4bf91bd059e881d539800b3d7a7bf7f1196","amp;dn":"Sheer+Terror-Love+Songs+For+The+Unloved+1995+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1df5e4bf91bd059e881d539800b3d7a7bf7f1196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,245,228,191,145,189,5,158,136,29,83,152,0,179,215,167,191,127,17,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
