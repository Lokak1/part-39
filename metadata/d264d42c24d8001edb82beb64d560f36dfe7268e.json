We're talking years ago, now. Apparently we're in the minority though, judging by the influx of Dragon Ball Z titles that have been pouring out of Japan like so much rice wine. Shin Budokai 2 returns to the fighting arenas and open landmasses of the first, and the PSP experience is surprisingly enjoyable, but pretty derivative. \n\nTo be honest, Shin Budokai 2 is hardly a true sequel - there is a new story to play through, simply titled 'Another Road', which pits Trunks against the nefarious Dabura, the pink, horned freak with giant ears and a dastardly goatee, and eventually Majin Buu. The story branches out based on which foe you defeat and what choices you make along the way - which cities you save and how well you perform. \n\nAt its core, combat is the focus of the game. Adventuring is just a means to an end - games like this live and die by their fighting engine. Happily, Budokai 2 takes the first game's move-sets and ups the responsiveness and flexibility. Basically, each character has a base set of moves, and these can be customised on the Boosters screen. By customising and increasing your powers, you're a little less likely to have your backside handed to you in battle - as we found after clearing the first few stages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d264d42c24d8001edb82beb64d560f36dfe7268e","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+Dragonball+z+Shin+Budokai+2+%5BPSP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d264d42c24d8001edb82beb64d560f36dfe7268e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,100,212,44,36,216,0,30,219,130,190,182,77,86,15,54,223,231,38,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
