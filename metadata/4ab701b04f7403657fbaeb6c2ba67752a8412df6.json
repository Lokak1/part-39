Signed to Mercury Nashville Records in 2003, Currington has released four studio albums for the label: 2003's Billy Currington, 2005's Doin' Somethin' Right, 2008's Little Bit of Everything, and 2010's Enjoy Yourself. These four albums have produced nine singles for Currington on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including the five #1 hits &quot;Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right&quot;, &quot;Good Directions&quot;, &quot;People Are Crazy&quot;, &quot;That's How Country Boys Roll&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer&quot;.

Doin' Somethin' Right produced his first Number One in &quot;Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right&quot;, followed by &quot;Why, Why, Why&quot; at #13 and another Number One in &quot;Good Directions&quot;. Co-written by Capitol Records artist Luke Bryan, the latter was the #2 country song of 2007 according to the Billboard Year-End charts. Doin' Somethin' Right is certified platinum by the RIAA. Doin' Somethin' Right also featured &quot;Lucille&quot; which was a song Currington covered from original artist Kenny Rogers.\n\nWhen he was a junior in Effingham County High School (Springfield, Georgia), Currington auditioned for a spot at Opryland, the renowned country music theme park located in Nashville, Tennessee, the country music capital. Failing the audition, after high school he moved to Nashville to pursue his career in country music. His first stint did not last too long, and he later sang for a bar named Cavalier Country Club in Georgia. In Nashville, Currington also worked for a concrete company, and also as a personal trainer. One of the clients he worked with as a personal trainer led Currington to recording demo tapes, as well as writing songs. He eventually had cuts by George Strait, Tracy Byrd, and Marty Raybon. After almost being offered to join RCA Records, he signed to Mercury Records in 2003.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab701b04f7403657fbaeb6c2ba67752a8412df6","amp;dn":"Billy+Currington+-+Must+Be+Doin%5C%27+Somethin%5C%27+Right+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab701b04f7403657fbaeb6c2ba67752a8412df6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,183,1,176,79,116,3,101,127,186,235,108,43,166,119,82,168,65,45,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
