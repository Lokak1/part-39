Indeed, despite the presence of mandolins, fiddles, and banjos -- as well as inclusion of the title track, a faithful cover of the A.P. Carter classic -- the trio's vaunted country leanings are less musical than thematic on No Depression, thanks in large part to singers/songwriters Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy's acute depictions of rural, blue-collar life. Like the Replacements -- never more obvious an influence than on this LP -- Uncle Tupelo's songs paint grim, unrelenting portraits of aimless Midwestern existence, split between days working on the opening cut's &quot;Factory Belt&quot; and nights spent blurry-eyed and wasted (&quot;Whiskey Bottle,&quot; &quot;Before I Break&quot;). Still, for all of the record's doleful cynicism -- virtually every cut nods toward dashed hopes, broken promises, and paralyzing fear -- there's an undeniable electricity afoot as well; by channeling the mournful clarity of country into the crackling fury of punk, No Depression brings new life to both musical camps.\n\n\n01 Graveshift Yard     Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     4:43\n02 That Year           Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     2:59\n03 Before I Break      Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     2:48\n04 No Depression       Carter                      2:20\n05 Factory Belt        Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     3:13\n06 Whiskey Bottle      Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     4:46\n07 Outdone             Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     2:48\n08 Train               Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     3:19\n09 Life Worth Livin'   Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     3:32\n10 Flatness            Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     2:58\n11 So Called Friend    Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     3:12\n12 Screen Door         Farrar, Heidorn, Tweedy     2:42\n13 John Hardy          Leadbelly                   2:21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99cd5d1bdfcfb42382232756dbece92a948700ba","amp;dn":"Uncle+Tupleo+-+No+Depression++%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99cd5d1bdfcfb42382232756dbece92a948700ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,205,93,27,223,207,180,35,130,35,39,86,219,236,233,42,148,135,0,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
