Two sides with aspirations of Champions League qualification meet at White Hart Lane, where Tottenham host Everton. Recent encounters have been tight, and their sixth draw in 12 meetings earlier in the season was notable only for Tottenham's controversial decision to allow goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to play on after suffering a head injury and losing consciousness late in the game. Defending champions Manchester United have struggled at Old Trafford under new manager David Moyes this season, but the visit of Fulham has traditionally provided home comforts. United have won 17 of the last 18 league meetings in Manchester, and Fulham's wretched defensive record this season does not hint at an upset.\n\n\nNotes:\nCaptured and encoded at 50fps to give much smoother movement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34904a9644032bf87f7eed64fb74c9e133bb56f4","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+2014-02-09+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34904a9644032bf87f7eed64fb74c9e133bb56f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,144,74,150,68,3,43,248,127,126,237,100,251,116,201,225,51,187,86,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
