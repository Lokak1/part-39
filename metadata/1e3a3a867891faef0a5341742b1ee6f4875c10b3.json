A nearly 15-minute &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love&quot; gives one the opportunity to compare the three very different trumpeters, &quot;Darn That Dream&quot; is a ballad feature for singer Dinah Washington, &quot;Move&quot; is taken at an incredible tempo which holds up for 14-and-a-half minutes and this set concludes with a four-song ballad medley; Brownie's playing on &quot;It Might as Well Be Spring&quot; is classic. A brilliant set that is highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3a3a867891faef0a5341742b1ee6f4875c10b3","amp;dn":"Clifford+Brown+-+Jam+Session","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e3a3a867891faef0a5341742b1ee6f4875c10b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,58,58,134,120,145,250,239,10,83,65,116,43,30,230,244,135,92,16,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
