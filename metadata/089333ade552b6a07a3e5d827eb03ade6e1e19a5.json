Through connections he made, the band was able to record a demo. Local airplay led to the band being signed by Wind-up Records, a label distributed by Sony BMG.\n\nBreaking Point's debut album, Coming of Age, was released in 2001 with a follow-up, Beautiful Disorder, released in 2005.\n\nTheir songs have been used in a number of films, including The Scorpion King and Fantastic Four, as well as a trailer for Biker Boyz. Additionally, their song &quot;One of a Kind&quot; is the entrance music for professional wrestler Rob Van Dam.\n\nIn mid-2006, Breaking Point toured the United States with former Creed frontman Scott Stapp. As of July 2007, guitarist Justin Rimer has been performing as a member of 12 Stones.\n\n\n\nCurrent band members\n\n    * Brett Erickson - Vocals, Lead Guitar\n    * Greg Edmondson - Bass Guitar\n    * Michael McManus - Drums\n\nFormer band members\n\n    * Jody Abbott - Drums\n    * Justin Rimer - Lead Guitar\n    * Aaron &quot;Zeke&quot; Dauner - Drums\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Point Discography:\nComing of Age\nThe first album by the alternative rock band Breaking Point, released in 2001.
