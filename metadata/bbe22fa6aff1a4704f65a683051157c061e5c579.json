It is the year 1881. For the last few months, the trains belonging to the famous railroad company, Twinnings &amp; Co have been the target of a whole series of hold-ups and ambushes. The management of the company has decided enough is enough and they have to put an end to the raids. It has offered a reward of $15,000 for anyone who captures the leader of the gang responsible.\n\nBut no one in and around El Paso has the courage to take on the might of the bandidos, so the outlaws just keep on robbing train after train.

Bounty hunter John Cooper pays a visit to the local Twinnings Co manager offering to end the railroad companys problems once and for all. He gathers together a gang of his old partners and declares war on the bandidos. But during his pursuit, which will take him through half of the southwestern United States, Cooper soon discovers that on this mission nothing is quite what it seems...\n\nInstall and Play.
