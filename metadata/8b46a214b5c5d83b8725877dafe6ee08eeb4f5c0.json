Your job is to help a small group of settlers survive and carve out a place for themselves in a hostile land. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step.\n\nStarting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines city sim and good old combat with infinite building possibilities. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built to be moddable at every level, from your city, to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends.\n\nBuild and Grow Your City\n\nThe heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders.\n\nOnce you've achieved a foothold in the world, it will be up to you to write the destiny for your people. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish.\n\nLevel Up Your Settlers\n\nAll the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your little guys work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain pre-requisites, can upgrade into entirely new jobs with new capabilities\n\nUsually to assign someone a new job you'll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a tech tree that's both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area.\n\nEpic Boss Fights!\n\nAs your town becomes more wealthy and prosperous, you risk attracting the attention of one of the world's Titans, epic boss monsters looking to protect their turf, or just to plunder your riches. Each boss will have a unique lore and set of abilities used to lay waste to your city.\n\nPlayer Driven Legacy Through Modding\n\nWe LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods.\n\nWant to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game.\n\nAs a modder youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where Ã¢â‚¬Å“the gameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster.
