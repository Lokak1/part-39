It has an incredible diversity of communities and cultures, yet we know less of its history than almost anywhere else on earth.\n\nBut that is beginning to change. In the last few decades researchers and archaeologists have begun to uncover a range of histories as impressive and extraordinary as anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe series reveals that Africa's stories are preserved for us in its treasures, statues and ancient buildings - in the culture, art and legends of the people.\n\nThe first episode looks at Nubia, in what is now northern Sudan, a kingdom that dominated a vast area of the eastern Sahara for thousands of years. Its people were described as barbarians and mercenaries, and yet Nubia has left us with some of the most spectacular monuments in the world.\n\nCasely-Hayford traces the origins of this fascinating kingdom back to 10,000 BC. He explores how it developed and what happened to it and its people, discovering that its kings once ruled Ancient Egypt and that it was defeated not by its rivals but by its environment.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a58958cadc717695c25d02a84de872e4bd23b6","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Kingdoms+of+Africa+ep+1+Nubia+BBC4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13a58958cadc717695c25d02a84de872e4bd23b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,165,137,88,202,220,113,118,149,194,93,2,168,77,232,114,228,189,35,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
