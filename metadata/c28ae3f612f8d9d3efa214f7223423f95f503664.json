Their radio-friendly sound debuted in 1976 with Fantasy Girls and the group managed a steady stream of moderate FM hits in the U.S. and the U.K., including 1978's &quot;Killer Cut&quot; and &quot;She Loves to Be in Love.&quot; However, Charlie's biggest success came with the 1983 hit &quot;It's Inevitable,&quot; which received considerable airplay from MTV and was featured on their self-titled seventh album. Despite the added prominence this single and tours with the Doobie Brothers, Styx, BTO, and the Kinks brought them, the group remained primarily a cult favorite for their nearly decade-long career. Charlie's swan song came in with In Pursuit of Romance, which featured Thomas as the only original member. - Heather Phares\n\nOfficial website: http://charlie-music.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c28ae3f612f8d9d3efa214f7223423f95f503664","amp;dn":"Charlie+-+Complete+Studio+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c28ae3f612f8d9d3efa214f7223423f95f503664","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,138,227,246,18,248,217,211,239,162,20,247,34,52,35,249,95,80,54,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
