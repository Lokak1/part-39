Four CDs gathering 100 songs from a wide-ranging cast of characters. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got proto-punks like the New York Dolls and Iggy Pop; key figures like the Ramones, The Buzzcocks, and The Clash; as well as artists like Talking Heads and Blondie, who quickly outgrew the punk label. A thoroughly researched 116-page booklet includes liners, rare photos, track-by-track commentary by Trouser Press founders Ira Robbins and Dave Schulps, and personal tributes by Johnny Ramone, David Byrne, Joan Jett, and others.\n\nWhen punk began it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so much a sound as an attitude. Before there was punk the genre -- narrowly defined by music that was loud, fast, and snotty -- there was punk the movement, where anything rebellious, intelligent, and unpretentious was embraced in the spirit of fun. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why you get well-dressed guys like Joe Jackson alongside fiends like The Cramps. What mattered was that, in their own way, these people all said Ã¢â‚¬Å“no thanksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the rock pomp and disco camp that ruled the charts through much of the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dd065cb1d775e57f6a47bd0754262287bd4c6e0","amp;dn":"No+Thanks%21+-+The+%5C%2770s+Punk+Rebellion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dd065cb1d775e57f6a47bd0754262287bd4c6e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,208,101,203,29,119,94,87,246,164,123,208,117,66,98,40,123,212,198,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
