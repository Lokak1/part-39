She is represented here by Speak to me pretty, her biggest UK hit but never released as a single in the USA, and Sweet nothings. Also from the early sixties are tracks by the Chiffons, the Shangri-las, Helen Shapiro, the Angels, the Crystals, Connie Francis, the Shirelles, the Dixie cups and Lesley Gore. Among their classic songs are Leader of the pack, Will you love me tomorrow and It's my party. Patsy cline, singing Crazy, is the only country singer represented here. The surprise omission from the early sixties is Locomotion by Little Eva. During this period, some American songs were UK hits via covers by British singers. Examples of these to be heard on this collection include Lover please (Vernon girls, cover of Clyde McPhatter), Tell him (Billie Davis, cover of Exciters) and Bobby's girl (Susan Maughan, cover of Marcie Blaine). So, the early sixties are well represented but things got even better from around 1964.From Motown came Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Diana Ross and the Supremes, the Marvelettes, Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Velvelettes and Mary Wells, all represented here and some by more than one track. Among their songs are Dancing in the street, Baby love and My guy. Aside from Motown, there are several other soul and R+B classics here, including tracks by Dionne Warwick, Betty Everett, Fontella Bass and Freda Payne (actually from 1970, but who's complaining?). Jamaican teenager Millie is represented by My boy Lollipop, which you either love or hate. I love it.Dusty Springfield (three tracks), Petula Clark (Downtown), Lulu (Shout), Sandie Shaw (Always something there to remind me) and Marianne Faithfull (This little bird) are the big British names from the mid to late sixties that you can find here, although Cilla Black and Shirley Bassey are among those missing.As ever with these compilations, there are plenty of famous songs but there are one or two rarities. I was particularly pleased to discover White horses, a top ten hit for Jacky that rarely gets released on compilations.It is always possible to argue over song selection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even artist selection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on various artist compilations of any kind, but there is no doubt that this is by far the strongest all-female sixties compilation I've come across.\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
