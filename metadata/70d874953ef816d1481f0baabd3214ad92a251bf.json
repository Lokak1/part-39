Now someone from her past is raising questions about what really happened that night. About Julie's own complicity. About a devastating secret her mother kept from them all. About the person who went to prison for Izzy's murder and the person who didn't.\n\nFaced with questions and armed with few answers, Julie must gather the courage to revisit her past and untangle the complex emotions that led to one unspeakable act of violence on the bay at midnight","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70d874953ef816d1481f0baabd3214ad92a251bf","amp;dn":"The+Bay+At+Midnight+by+Diane+Chamberlain+%28RETAiL%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70d874953ef816d1481f0baabd3214ad92a251bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,216,116,149,62,248,22,209,72,31,11,170,189,50,20,173,146,162,81,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
