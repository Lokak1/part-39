Among those affected, each in his or her own way, by all the bubbles, burps, and foam, was a smart, wide-eyed, adventurous kindergartner named Gracie; her distracted mommy; her insensitive dad; her non-conformist uncle; and a magical, butt-kicking intruder from a world within our world.\n\nPopulated by the aforementioned characters--and as charming as it may be subversive--B Is for Beer involves readers, young and old, in a surprising, far-reaching investigation into the limits of reality, the transformative powers of children, and, of course, the ultimate meaning of a tall, cold brewski. \n\nBitrate 64kbps\nRead By Laurie Silverman.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHuge selection of audiobooks available at the blog.\n\nIf you visit please take the time to click on a few ads.
