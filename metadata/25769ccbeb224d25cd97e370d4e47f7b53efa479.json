Its galvanized and finely tuned side-scrolling bullet-hell shoot-'em-up gameplay sets it well above most other games in the genre. The game is deceptively simple from the outset, but has very well-thought-out gameplay mechanics. There are multiple playable characters, expertly crafted enemies and bullet patterns, a variable-difficulty &quot;Phase Level&quot; system, a risk-and-reward bullet &quot;Friction&quot; system, a &quot;Demonic Shift&quot; ability that's not for the faint of heart, and much more.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 5 levels of intense bullet-flying action\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sweet Old school retro anime-style art\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Two playable characters to choose from and a third you can unlock\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Story, Practice and Mission modes to take your shooting skills to the max\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 32 Steam achievements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full online leaderboards\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New arranged soundtrack by DM Ashura\n\nUPLOADER'S NOTE: This is a corrected version of my previous upload at https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7149357/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25769ccbeb224d25cd97e370d4e47f7b53efa479","amp;dn":"Gundemonium+Recollection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25769ccbeb224d25cd97e370d4e47f7b53efa479","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,118,156,203,235,34,77,37,205,151,227,112,212,228,127,123,83,239,164,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
