I did my best to find as many tracks from any other official promo only rips (e.g. rhythm, mainstream). I found about 2/3rds of the tracks that way. The others were gathered elsewhere, and may not be clean versions. \n\nBelow is a list of tracks that I know are the original/dirty versions. If you have any of these songs in a clean version, or if you notice any other tracks that are obviously not radio edits, or if there's any other problems, please let me know in the comments (on thepiratebay.se). \n\n*** alternate/dirty tracks ***\n[aug]\n02- beyonce- best thing i never had\t\t\tnot Ã¢â‚¬Å“DJ Mike D RemixÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n[oct]\n04- lil wayne (f t pain)- how to hate [dirty ver]\tnot promo only clean ver\n05- cj hilton (f nas)- so fresh\t\t\t\tnot promo only clean ver\n10- mary j blige- the living proof\t\t\tmay not be unplugged ver\n15- bei maejor (f j cole)- trouble\t\t\tnot promo only clean ver\n17- red cafe (f rick ross, ryan leslie)- fly together\tnot promo only clean ver\n19- razah (f ne yo)- my girl [dj jboogie edit]\t\tdj mix (almost the same)\n[nov]\n06- miguel (f twista)- quickie (remix)\t\t\t?&quot;after midnight mix&quot;\n07- young jeezy (f ti)- fame\t\t\t\tnot promo only clean ver\n08- david banner- swag\t\t\t\t\tnot promo only clean ver\n14- birdman (f nicki minaj, lil wayne)- yu mad\t\tnot promo only clean ver\n18- plies (f jeremih, ludacris)- just (the tip)\t\tnot promo only clean ver\n[dec]\n(none)\n\n\nThis took me awhile to compile... hope y'all enjoy! \n~LKS\n\n***********************************************************************************\nP.S.
