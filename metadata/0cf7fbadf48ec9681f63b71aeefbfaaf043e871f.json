Over the years, between the astonishingly brilliant covers of countless comics, we have seen acts of unspeakable evil and of unwavering heroism; the very worst and the very best humanity (and super-humanity) has to offer. All of this can be seen on the pages of any Marvel Comic. Marvel's powers-that-be wanted to know which issues resonated most with the Marvel readers. So, they printed and tallied over 50,000 ballots, and in doing so discovered that everybody has their own favorite comic.\n\nThis collection is dedicated to anyone who has ever bagged and boarded an issue.
