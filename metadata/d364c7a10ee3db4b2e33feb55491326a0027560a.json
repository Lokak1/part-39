Instead, she ends up trapped on a remote mountain by a big game hunter whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hell-bent on bagging a werewolf. Lonely alpha wolf-shifter Jack, the last of the once-strong Half Moon Pack, is his target. Jack is determined to keep Mandy safe while hunting his hunter, but being around Jack brings out a wild side Mandy never knew she had. As silver bullets fly, so do sparks. If they can manage to defeat their attacker, Mandy will still have one problem to contend with: Jack is convinced that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his mate.\n\nTrue Alpha (Half Moon Shifters #2) by Ranae Rose (July 5th 2012)\n\nWith a baby on the way, Mandy and Jack are prepared for their pack of two to expand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or so they think, until JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only remaining relatives return unexpectedly from Alaska, bringing others with them. Suddenly, the alpha couple has a lot more to worry about than what color to paint the nursery. But inter-pack dramas, baby shower plans and even a wedding canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t compare to the mayhem that ensues when a stranger from MandyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past shows up at the cabinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doorstep, hiding a secret that could destroy the Half Moon Pack forever.\n\nA Taste of Honey (Half Moon Shifters #3) by Ranae Rose (September 21st 2012)\n\nLove at first sight? Not exactly. Things work a little differently for wolf shifters, though hunky park ranger Ronnie is a dream to look at, especially when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in uniform. VioletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s senses have been telling her heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one since the first time she caught a hint of his scent. Could she really be destined to be the mate of a bear shifter? Their differences are undeniable, but that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stopped her from wondering what it would be like to live happily ever after with the drop-dead sexy ranger who also serves as war chief of the Great Smoky MountainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resident bear shifter tribe. But bears donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t detect their mates by scent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their methods are scintillatingly personal. Tension simmers, and one thing will either make or break both of their hopes for the future Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a taste of honey.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d364c7a10ee3db4b2e33feb55491326a0027560a","amp;dn":"Half+Moon+Shifters+Series+%281-3%29+by+Ranae+Rose+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d364c7a10ee3db4b2e33feb55491326a0027560a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,100,199,161,14,227,219,75,46,51,254,181,84,145,50,106,0,39,86,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
