Many virtual footballers love with what the game has offered because sport interactive, which developed it, has mounted the game with a better training system manager and team management.\n\n\nDiscussion:-\n\nFootball Manager 2011 is without a doubt incredibly deep and engaging. The realistic feeling surrounding the entire game and massive amount of features makes it exciting and great fun, but at the same time it can easily make it daunting and tiresome. It sometimes seems to test your patience and endurance to a high degree, but for the right candidate this is a realistic, impressively in-depth and near masterful simulation of the role of a manager of a soccer team.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ There is a very steep learning curve, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be required to either have lots of knowledge of the sport or have the ability to learn.\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In the early hours of the game you can easily become overwhelmed and unsure of what to do first, and the hints and guidelines donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always help in this regard.\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ There are often so many things to attend to that you can either end up neglecting certain aspects or losing a great many hours to the game ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ despite it being addictive enough on its own. Furthermore, all these hours spent while tackling all of these activities in question might only progress you forward very little, but in the end this is the essence of the game.\n\nFootball Manager 2011 Tech Info:-\n\nPublisher:Sega\n Developer:Sports Interactive\n Genre:Soccer Management\n Release Date:Nov 5, 2010(more) \n ESRB:EVERYONE\n\nFM 2011 system requirements for PC:-\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¸ OS: Windows XP/Vista/W7\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¸ Processor: XP : 1.4GHz or Faster, Vista/W7 : 2.0GHz or Faster\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¸ Memory: XP : 512MB RAM, Vista/W7 : 1.0GB RAM\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¸ Graphics: 128MB Supported Chipsets ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nvidia FX 5900 Ultra or greater; ATI Radeon 9800 or greater; Intel 82915G/82910GL or greater.
