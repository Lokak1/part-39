Coming from a shattered and splattered background of no wave, pop, darkness and hope, Abe Vigoda bring forth a sound that is tempting and beautiful, yet melodic and tropical. \n\nThe first proper full length comes in the name Skeleton and is a twisted joy ride through the four boys\u0019 private party. Soothing parts that remind you of Captain Beefheart and My Bloody Valentine, or some punk with a haunting reggaeton pulse that makes you move. When the record is done after a little more than thirty minutes, you are left feeling that there is something they are trying to tell you, on second listen it smacks you in the face... Abe Vigoda are here! Coming from the same team as The Smell champions No Age and Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda hold a DIY attitude and lay all over the place whenever they can, bringing an instant vibe all their own.\n\n\n\n-Save a baby kitten and seed why dont ya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:042e0651f76e7e3b4c59e93c7716a3258eee04ec","amp;dn":"Abe+Vigoda+-+Skeleton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"042e0651f76e7e3b4c59e93c7716a3258eee04ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,46,6,81,247,110,126,59,76,89,233,60,119,22,163,37,142,238,4,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
