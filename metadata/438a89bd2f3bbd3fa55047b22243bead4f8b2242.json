I have verified with several people that this copy works.  If you have issues, check your own machine, cause its NOT this installer.  Milviz recommends disabling your anti-virus prior to installation.  Do as you wish, but that's what they say, and that's what WE did.  As always, if you like it, BUY it!  Support great developers!\n\n*** YOU MUST HAVE 7-Zip TO PROPERLY EXTRACT!!! ***\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHigh Performance and Packed with Features!\n\nThe MV 407 model depicted in this package is a highly detailed replica of its real-life counterpart. The model was created by using high quality digital photos and many, many countless hours of testing, revising and testing again!\n\nOutstanding features of this aircraft are:\n\n-Realistic startup and shutdowns\n\n-Realistic systems and avionics\n\n-High quality external model using normal and specular maps\n\n-High resolution paint kit\n\n-High quality sound set recorded from a real 407\n\n-Custom realistic DX10/DX11 night lighting, landing lights and custom effects.\n\n-Flight dynamics tested and tuned by real pilots.

By Brandon Filer and Chuck Jodry!\n\n-Lots of liveries include\n\n\n\nProduct Support\n\nNONE THIS IS TPB!!\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n\nThis product requires FSX SP2 or P3D. Note: the Flight 1 version doesn't support V2. It is also designed for newer systems. Minimum requirements are 2.6 Core 2 Duo, 1024mb Video Card and 1.2 Gigs of free disk space. Optimal requirements are higher.\n\nWindows XP is NOT supported.\n\n***Support for P3D is not supplied at this time though the installer does allow for it.
