(NOTE: An Android-compatible game controller, such as the Nvidia Shield Controller, is required to play and two controllers are required for local co-op play).\n\nOn over 75 &quot;Best of 2014&quot; lists, and winner of &quot;Best Debut Game&quot; at the 2015 BAFTA Games Awards as well as &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Most Significant Impact&quot; at the 2015 Games for Change Awards, nearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the making of the game.\n\nYou'll explore awe-inspiring environments, perform heroic deeds, and meet legendary characters from IÃƒÂ±upiaq stories Ã¢â‚¬â€ all narrated by a master storyteller in the spoken IÃƒÂ±upiaq language.\n\nThe rich and atmospheric arctic environments of Never Alone are best experienced on Nvidia Shield devices.\n\nFEATURES\n\nPlay as both Nuna and Fox Ã¢â‚¬â€ Switch between the two companions at any time with one button press, or play side by side in local co-op mode, as you rely on the unique skills of each character to succeed in your quest. Nuna can climb ladders and ropes, move heavy obstacles, and throw her bola at targets to solve puzzles. Fox can fit through small areas that Nuna can't reach, scramble up walls, and jump to great heights.\n\nBrave the harsh world of the Arctic Ã¢â‚¬â€ Run under, through, and atop the unstable structures of an abandoned coastal village. Explore the eerily quiet treetops of a mysterious, frozen forest. Brave the fierce winds of the eternal blizzard.
