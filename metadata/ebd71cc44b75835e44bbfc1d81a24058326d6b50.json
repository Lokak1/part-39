Out for a drive, Chet and Bernie run into a prison work crew featuring an old criminal friend they helped send to prison, Frenchie Boutette. From an old Louisiana family full of black sheep, Frenchie needs Bernie and ChetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help in locating his brother, Ralph, who has disappeared with his houseboat. But before they can head off to the bayou, Bernie is attacked by a member of a strange gang called the Queiros. And though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tempted to take another job (with a big payday) in Alaska, Bernie and Chet set course for Louisiana.\n\nA reclusive inventor, Ralph is the sole law-abiding member of his family. Full of black sheep, the Boutette family has a long running feud with the no-good Robideaus and at first it seems as if RalphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance is connected to a dispute over a load of heisted shrimp. But when Chet uncovers a buried clue, the investigation heads in a new and dangerous direction and what was a simple disappearance gets complicated as a conspiracy involving the oil business is uncovered. The more Chet and Bernie discover about Ralph, the more dangerous the job becomes and soon theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fighting not only Big Oil, but also shadowy black ops figures, the Quieros, and IkoÃ¢â‚¬â€a gator with an insatiable appetite.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd71cc44b75835e44bbfc1d81a24058326d6b50","amp;dn":"The+Sound+and+The+Furry+-+Spencer+Quinn.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd71cc44b75835e44bbfc1d81a24058326d6b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,215,28,196,75,117,131,94,68,187,252,29,129,162,64,88,50,109,107,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
