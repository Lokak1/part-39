But from today on, he has decided that he is Ã¢â‚¬ËœhappyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and that he is no longer sick. JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roommate James is a healthy, dreamy young man. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re best friends. They live together. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do much of anything, and seem very happy that way. But trouble arises when James announces that he will be leaving for his new job in the morning. Jimmy sees this as the destruction of the perfect little world that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve set up, and what ensues is a humorous battle of wills as James heads towards the real world and Jimmy falls deeper and deeper into his isolated world of illness and make-believe.\n\nGenre: Comedy | Drama\nIMDB Rating: 3.2/10 from 110 users\nDirected by: Matt DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Elia\nStarring: Matt DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Elia, Brendan Fletcher and Mircea Monroe\n\nRelease Name: American.Animal.2011.DVDRiP.XVID-TASTE\nSize: 700 MiB\nVideo: XViD | 640Ãƒâ€”352 | 892 kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 35mn 24s\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a92437aa3d606b004b76584b737d1cb27530eeae","amp;dn":"American.Animal.2011.DVDRip.XviD-TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a92437aa3d606b004b76584b737d1cb27530eeae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,36,55,170,61,96,107,0,75,118,88,75,115,125,28,178,117,48,238,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
