Fingerprint play a fine brand of rock that crosses Le Roux/ Roadmaster like pomp with Autographs guitar crunch and leaves you like a drug addict,begging for more and asking, &quot;why only 5 tracks God&quot;? This is a real undiscovered classic and is the fuel for people like me as we wear out countless pairs of shoes in our search for the motherlode and hidden perfection. &quot;Catch A Star&quot; Fingerprints penultimate track, was originally covered by LIMOUSINE (Chassis Recs 1982) on their excellent self-titled debut.This was probably something to do with the fact that Brett Hansen was a one time guitarist of the band, and no doubt a founding member. It is a rare ep,\n\nReissued in 2008, with different artwork.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Fingerprint - On File\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Fingerprint\nAlbum................: On File\nGenre................: AOR\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1984\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: , ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: grayghost on 1/6/2009\nPosted by............: grayghost on 1/6/2009\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\nCovers...............: Front Back \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
