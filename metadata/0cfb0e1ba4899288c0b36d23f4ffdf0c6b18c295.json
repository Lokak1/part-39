Ã¢â‚¬â€ Adam has pursued Eve since the dawn of creation, intent on using her power to create a new world and make himself its God. Throughout history, Eve has thwarted him, determined to protect the world and all of creation. \n\nUnknown to her, the Norse god Thor has been sent by the Council of Gods to keep her from Adam's influence, and more, to protect the interests of the gods themselves. But this time, Adam is after something more than just Eve's power Ã¢â‚¬â€ he desires her too, body and soul, even if it means the destruction of the world. \n\nEve cannot allow it, but as one generation melds into the next, she begins to wonder if Adam might be a man she could love.\nEvery god, from each of the world's pantheons, mythologies, and religions Ã¢â‚¬â€ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all real in this enthralling fantasy romance that spans centuries.\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfb0e1ba4899288c0b36d23f4ffdf0c6b18c295","amp;dn":"Forged+by+Fate+by+Amalia+Dillin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfb0e1ba4899288c0b36d23f4ffdf0c6b18c295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,251,14,27,164,137,146,136,192,179,109,35,244,255,223,12,107,24,194,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
