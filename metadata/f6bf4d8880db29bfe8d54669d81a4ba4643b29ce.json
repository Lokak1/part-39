The first series aired from February 2011 on Channel 4. A second series has been commissioned by Channel 4. The series began airing in the U.S. on BBC America as of 30 July, 2011. The comedy is focused around the regular Friday dinner experience of an English Jewish family (the Goodmans) on each Friday night. From the context of the episodes it appears that only the mother and sons are Jewish as the husband was reminded of their sons being Jewish when Adam was given a book of the Heroes of the German SS WW2 as a birthday present.
