Inside that image of E.L.O.'s spaceship (here updated without the 8-track docking bay), one imagines a ye olde discotheque stuffed with Beatles mannequins and powered by pump organ synthesizers. The genius of Jeff Lynne is to fuse kindergarten rock &amp; roll, ultra-Liverpudlian choruses, and faux-symphonic instrumentation with a pop that's both sappy and supple. With only a few duff tracks, this timeless, invigorating disc is a rocking, left-field surprise. Talk about a comeback--Zoom is nothing short of a revelation for fans of this critically underappreciated group. Lynne sings on the opening cut, &quot;Alright,&quot; that &quot;You've got to hold onto something that you believe / Hold onto something that makes you feel alright,&quot; and the entire album bears this out with grace and wit\n1. Alright\n2. Moment In Paradise\n3. State Of Mind\n4. Just For Love\n5. Stranger On A Quiet Street\n6. In My Own Time\n7. Easy Money\n8. It Really Doesn't Matter\n9. Ordinary Dream\n10. A Long Time Gone\n11. Melting In The Sun\n12. All She Wanted\n13. Lonesome Lullaby\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j81/wrcfoucs/watching3vemq8.gif[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j81/wrcfoucs/dontseed.gif[/IMG]\n\n[img]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o219/uuffoo/vghlr7.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i447.photobucket.com/albums/qq195/mariokazg/20qdrhe.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92fcda80bf958851e0bfafac3d89ce8da5cc8dbb","amp;dn":"Electric+Light+Orchestra_Zoom%28SPLIT+TRACKS%2BCOVERS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92fcda80bf958851e0bfafac3d89ce8da5cc8dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,252,218,128,191,149,136,81,224,191,175,172,61,137,206,141,165,204,141,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
