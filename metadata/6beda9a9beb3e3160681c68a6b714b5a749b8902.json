If you haven't seen Soul Eater, it's advisable to watch it before watching Soul Eater Not!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nBrief Synopsis: (stolen from wikipedia)\n\nThe Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA) is a special institution for humans who are born with the power to turn into weapons and the wielders of these weapons, called meisters. While the students of the EAT (Especially Advantaged Talent) class train themselves to become warriors of justice, the NOT (Normally Overcome Target) class is for those who just want to control their powers with the intent to not become a threat to others and to themselves. Tsugumi Harudori is a halberd demon weapon who takes part in the NOT class and befriends two meisters, Meme Tatane and Anya Hepburn, becoming indecisive about which one of them to choose as her partner. The series follows the daily lives of Tsugumi and her friends as they learn the ropes of the DWMA and have occasional encounters with the characters of the main series.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFormat:\nMKV\n\nResolution:\n1280x720 (HD)\n\nProblems opening the files?\nOpen MKV files with Media Player Classic, VLC, or other file players that have MKV capabilities.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFan subbed &amp; Provided by HorribleSubs\n(Please note that I am not affiliated with HorribleSubs in any way, and am just an avid supporter of them, and what they do.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6beda9a9beb3e3160681c68a6b714b5a749b8902","amp;dn":"Soul+Eater+Not%21+%2AComplete%2A+Episodes+1-12+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6beda9a9beb3e3160681c68a6b714b5a749b8902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,237,169,169,190,179,227,22,6,129,198,138,107,113,75,90,116,155,137,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
