These sonatas, performed here by Valentina Lisitsa, are also available at torrent #5592430 and also on YouTube, and in both cases also at 1080p.\n\n2. Here I have combined and converted them (without any encoding or loss of quality) to AVI format in order to have them play without interruption, as they most definitely should in the way they are laid out here.\n\n3. For instance the Hammerklavier sonatas 1-5 should not be broken up into 5 different segments as there is no pause between the first two and the last three movements. You could break it up into 1-2 and then 3-5 of course.\n\n4. Moonlight, similarly, could be broken up as movements 1-2 followed by 3 and the Appassionata sonatas as 1 followed by 2-3 together.\n\n5. Anyway, that's all very complicated and it's much easier to just group them by title and, if possible, glue the various movements together (by demultiplex/multiplex using avidemux as I have done here) without having to re-encode the video data (or audio) data.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Points 1, 3 and 4 still hold true, whereas 2 and 5 no longer do. The reason being that I noticed the Appassionata sonata's movement NÃ‚Âº3 happened to be quite a bit lower in volume than NÃ‚Âºs 1 and 2. So I decided to split it up and re-encode the audio for NÃ‚Âº3 at a higher volume. \n\n    No problem, I split up the file and by lucky coincidence I happened to be using &quot;Any Video Converter&quot; earlier on to convert some AAC &quot;YouTube&quot; audio to AC3 (Dolby) at a higher sampling frequency (but similar data rate). So it was set to convert whatever the incoming audio was to AC3, 192 kbps @ 48.0 KHz which is a format that can be used to encode a much higher quality sound source (even at the same data rate) than say AAC, 126 kbps @ 44.1 KHz (which is what the other versions of these sonatas have their audio encoded as).\n\n    Now the question is: what if the source audio is AAC, 126 kbps @ 44.1 KHz, will there be any change in the quality of the audio by simply changing formats? I mean there's no more data! Shouldn't it sound the same? or worse?\n\n    And the answer to that question, I believe (though my speakers are not good enough for me to say with certainty) is &quot;yes&quot;. The quality of the reformatted input, normalized and increased in volume does appear to be (to me) far and away SUPERIOR to their YouTube AAC sources!\n\n    Something for nothing? Perhaps. But it may just be that the AC3 codec is designed to clarify a &quot;dirty&quot; source such that one can increase the volume and have what was previously barely audible be pulled out of the noise and then discard the noise. Get it? Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ same data rate, minus the noise, and you have a richer sound that can be sampled at a higher frequency so that the higher pitched tones actually sound like they're at the correct volume!\n\n    I'm not sure. To me this sounds 100% better than the sources they were encoded from. If you don't believe me, listen to this on YouTube and then these AVI's and tell me they sound the same. Or that the AAC versions sound better. I doubt you would say so!\n\n- user10196\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea39999964d35d25483ba490b1686c77d744b85","amp;dn":"Beethoven.Sonatas.Valentina.Lisitsa.AC3.AVC.1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea39999964d35d25483ba490b1686c77d744b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,163,153,153,150,77,53,210,84,131,186,73,11,22,134,199,125,116,75,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
