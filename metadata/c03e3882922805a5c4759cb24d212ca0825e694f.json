First we must embark upon a gritty, dimly lit poetic journey through the dark hour, looking for the new dawn. Once we have found this new hope, we must stay true to the path and finish our quest. We ultimately find ourselves on a grim, fateful journey through the horrors of night, only to find tales of fantasy and hope at the end. The dark passages within this book contain a range of poetic and prosaic writing styles in one compilation that is thick with liminalism and imagery.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.moonlitjourneypoetry.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.moonlitjourneypoetry.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA sample poem -\n\nFarewell Party (Leaving the Old Church)\nThe ravens on the roof\nStand guard like gargoyles -\nThese grim feathered ghouls\nPerch atop the once proud passages\nThat they now pretend to own,\nAnd sing a sad a cappella\nIn mockery of memory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03e3882922805a5c4759cb24d212ca0825e694f","amp;dn":"Moonlit+Journey+poetry+E-Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03e3882922805a5c4759cb24d212ca0825e694f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,62,56,130,146,40,5,165,196,117,156,178,77,33,44,160,130,94,105,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
