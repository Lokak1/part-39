He also wrote quite a few hillbilly boogie, and rockabilly tunes, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tennessee Hound DogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“MailmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Johnny BondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sick, Sober and SorryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Tex Atchison started recording in the 1930s with the Kentucky Ramblers, who became the Prairie Ramblers. In the post war era, he played with Merle Travis (40Ã¢â‚¬Â²s-50Ã¢â‚¬Â²s), Ole RasmussenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nebraska Cornhuskers, and Leon Chappel in the early 50Ã¢â‚¬Â²s. Tex became famous for his Western Swing fiddle playingÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and as a teenager, he would be digging coal by day, and play fiddle, sax and clarinet at night, in coal miner dance halls. Tex Atchison was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arguably the best left-handed fiddler in the history of country musicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by country historian Charles K. Wolfe. Being a Southpaw myself, I always have an affinity for a left handed muso.\n \nWritten by Tex Atchison, Scotty Harrell, and Eddie Hazelwood\n \nTIm Armstrong-Vocals, Guitar\nJim Doyle-Drums\nBrett Simons- Bass\nHunter Perrin- Guitar\nJohn Morrical- Piano","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b794bf2d4f57b8258eea6359ede9c98f6511d3","amp;dn":"Honky+Tonk+Hardwood+Floor+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b794bf2d4f57b8258eea6359ede9c98f6511d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,183,148,191,45,79,87,184,37,142,234,99,89,237,233,201,143,101,17,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
