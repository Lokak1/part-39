Getting rained on will spike their \r\ncomfort, clothing and warmth needs. \r\n\r\n- Prisoners left outside in extremely cold conditions (for example in an outdoor solitary confinement cage) \r\ncan now die of exposure. \r\n\r\n- Weather is DISABLED by default in all prisons, and can be enabled when creating a new map. \r\nAlternatively, use the new &quot;Map Settings&quot; screen in the Extras menu. \r\n\r\n\r\n= Map Settings \r\nYou can now adjust the settings of your prison from a new screen called &quot;Map Settings&quot;, found in the Extras menu. \r\nThis screen lets you enable certain options that may not have been enabled (or even available) when you first created the map. \r\nNb. You can enable these options, but you cannot disable them once enabled. \r\n\r\nAvailable options: \r\n- Enable Gangs \r\n- Enable Events \r\n- Enable Weather \r\n\r\n\r\n= Job Prioritisation \r\n- You can now mark any job as a high priority. Simple hold control and either \r\nleft click or left drag a selection to mark jobs. Available workers (who aren't \r\nalready on a high priority job) will stop what they are doing and be assigned \r\nto the high priority job. \r\n\r\n- If no workers are available, high priority jobs will take precedence when the \r\nworkers become available. A small icon in the lower right of a visible job shows \r\nif it is marked as a high priority job. \r\n\r\n- You can remove the high priority marking on jobs by holding control and either \r\nright clicking or dragging a selection. \r\n\r\n- Hovering over an in progress job will now highlight the entity working on it, \r\nshowing a red line leading to the worker responsible for the job. \r\n\r\n- Pressing F while highlighting an in progress job will cause the camera to follow \r\nthe working entity and keep the highlight active. \r\n\r\n\r\n= Performance Work (continued) \r\nFurther performance gains were made this month through several different approaches to optimisation. \r\n\r\n- More systems moved to overlap with Render(). \r\n- Optimisations to the visible object list builder. \r\n- Singly linked lists mostly replaced with arrays (FastList). \r\n- Avoid copying of containers where possible. \r\n- NeedSystem optimised. \r\n\r\n\r\n= Bug Fixes \r\nTemperature and lightmap system corruption bug fixed. \r\n\r\n- 0010618: [Gameplay] Temperature next to fire is in the negatives \r\n- 0010625: [Gameplay] Temperature drops instantly even in areas that should be producing heat \r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen Prison architect update 6b.exe , wait for a bit for the self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the game folder, open the extracted folder and play.....\r\nOR\r\nExtract it yourself using 'WinRAR'\r\n\r\nAlways open the game using run as administrator\r\n\r\nCheck my FB page for more :\r\nMr DJ repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be2edee5be14810cf99506a340829053f8c7b0f3","amp;dn":"Prison+Architect+Update+6b+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be2edee5be14810cf99506a340829053f8c7b0f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,46,222,229,190,20,129,12,249,149,6,163,64,130,144,83,248,199,176,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
