Forget what you have seen in the movies. The fact is more shocking than the fiction.\n\nThe television series Crime Inc was produced in 1984 by the Thames Television, then offered for American syndication. This brilliantly assembled seven-part documentary of the rise of organized crime in America during the Prohibition years lay on the shelf until Geraldo Rivera's 1986 'investigation' of Al Capone's vault turned out to be the highest-rated syndicated special in history. The suddenly renewed interest in past criminal activity enabled D. L. Taffner, Crime Inc's distributor, to secure choice play dates in many American TV markets.\n\nThe project had an advantage over most documentaries in having interviews with modern day villains including ex-Los Angelas crime boss and noted hitman, Jimmy 'The Weasel' Fratianno, and the refined and smooth talking Ray Ferritto...the hitman who blew up Irishman Danny Greene, solving the mob's problems in Cleveland. Crime Inc later ran on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable service as 'Crime in America'.\n\nEpisode 2 : Making of the Mob\nThis episode is an in-depth look into the shady underworld of the Mob. Starting with the government's prohibition of alcohol that gave the mob its foothold in the underbelly of America, to the illicit high-stakes drug wars that take place on the streets of today, in this second episode we see the gangsters and thugs that rose to notoriety within the violent world of organized crime.\n\n\nWritten and Narrated Martin Short\nDirectors : Ken Craig and Ian Stuttard\nSeries Producer : John Edwards\n\nThames Television Production (1984)\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n----------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2064 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 624x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.345:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:22.120\nNumber Of Parts: 7\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc14d4ec32352f04d04412ba4f09cf540e6c1e67","amp;dn":"Thames.Television.Crime.Inc.2of7.Making.of.the.Mob.XviD.AC3.MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc14d4ec32352f04d04412ba4f09cf540e6c1e67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,20,212,236,50,53,47,4,208,68,18,186,79,9,207,84,14,108,30,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
