Others make you think to get through a series of complicated puzzles. Violet Storm doesn't have any of that. What is does have is pure, intense, unabashedly over-the-top, non-stop action - rendered in a fantastic glowing-neon style with fast-paced techno music in the background. It also has enemies - plenty of them.\n\nThey come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, and all are coming for you, one way or another, in an infinite series of increasingly challenging waves to repel. To help you do that, we've included some fittingly over-the-top weapons. \n\nTake, for example, a super-multi-laser bomb, which, when it explodes, shoots thirty-two rotating laser rays in all directions, destroying everything in its path. Or a five-way, triple-bullet blaster, firing at an insane 1,000 rounds per second.\nDon't miss all the mayhem - download Violet Storm right now and join the fun!\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Insanely fast-paced, action-packed, over-the-top combat\n- 25 different enemy and 10 weapon system types!\n- Quad-damage, invincibility , mega-laser-bomb powerups (and more!)\n- 3 different gameplay modes, including Speed Havoc and Sniper Mode\n- Infinite waves of varying and increasingly powerful enemies\n- Fantastic futuristic design and graphics\n- Fast-paced, energizing background music\n- Autosave so you never lose your progress\n- 3 difficulty levels\n- Local and global high scores\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- Minor bug fixes.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sadcatsoft.VioletStorm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sadcatsoft.VioletStorm&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44635b2b26399b1d1ff22565f644876baeb6338e","amp;dn":"Violet+Storm+v1.01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44635b2b26399b1d1ff22565f644876baeb6338e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,99,91,43,38,57,155,29,31,242,37,101,246,68,135,107,174,182,51,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
