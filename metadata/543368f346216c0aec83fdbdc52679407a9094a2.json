With three children, houses, yachts, fabulous wealth, and a long lasting marriage, they appear to be a conventional couple, but the reality of their personal life is startlingly different from the public faÃ¢Ë†Å¡ÃƒÅ¸ade. Zane Grey became the name for a huge enterprise based on his writing, which included books, magazine serials, film and stage versions, childrenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s books and even comic strips, but he did not create this enterprise alone: Dolly guided, directed and managed his career. After editing his hand written manuscripts, she handled the business of publishing, meeting and negotiating with publishers, overseeing contracts, directing arrangements with movie studios, managing the finances, keeping her eye on the book market, determining how many and which manuscripts should be published, and perhaps most importantly, maintaining the facade of a conventional married life. His numerous affairs with other women might have threatened his reputation. Most of these relationships lasted many years. Dolly knew all about them, and both Dolly and Zane took great pains to hide his affairs. Much of their married life was spent apart and their marriage was sustained by a constant correspondence. It is in these letters that the nature of the marriage is revealed. It is also in these letters that we can see the extent of DollyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s participation in his business life as well as her own remarkable personality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543368f346216c0aec83fdbdc52679407a9094a2","amp;dn":"Letters+From+A+Marriage+-+Dolly+And+Zane+Grey+%282008%29+%28473p%29+%5BInu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543368f346216c0aec83fdbdc52679407a9094a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,51,104,243,70,33,108,10,236,131,253,189,197,38,121,64,122,144,148,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
