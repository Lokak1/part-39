All he had to do to get off his sentence was to go for treatment and rehabilitation at the 51 Serif St. house. But when he arrives, he realizes there is more to the place than he thought. Patients start acting weird, the staff is secretive and abusive, and our protagonist finds himself doubting the rehabilitation he was led to believe he was receiving.\n\nThere is a website for the 51 Serif St collective with some free to read content, and the Kickstarter page, which contains a good deal of information, is still up for this book. \n\nThis is a pretty cook book. Got an obvious (Radoiu mentions it at the Kickstarter page) Dave McKean, Ben Templesmith, Ashley Wood vibe goin' on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fc68eac7bdccd933803d631a8ca6a34ee40f2e","amp;dn":"51+Serif+St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fc68eac7bdccd933803d631a8ca6a34ee40f2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,252,104,234,199,189,204,217,51,128,61,99,26,140,166,163,78,228,15,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
