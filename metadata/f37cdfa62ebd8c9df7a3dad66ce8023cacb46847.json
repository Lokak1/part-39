She will soon discover extreme poverty and a devastatingly bleak educational system that leaves out the most needy. She initially protests and later decides to get married out of convenience, so as to legalize her situation and take on an ambitious educational project in the slums of Kathmandu. She immediately realizes that she can't do it all by herself. She also discovers a beautiful gift she had never expected: to fall in love with the stranger she marries. She finds herself torn between her love life and her commitment to the children she helps. Laia and Sharmila, another young teacher who becomes her dearest friend, work side by side to launch a new project that will distance Laia from her partner beyond repair. It will, however, always unite her to Sharmila and small Kushila, in a personal journey into the depths of the Nepalese society and also to her most inner self.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f37cdfa62ebd8c9df7a3dad66ce8023cacb46847","amp;dn":"Kathmandu+%28mirror+in+the+sky%29+%5Bblack-14%5D.WEBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f37cdfa62ebd8c9df7a3dad66ce8023cacb46847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,124,223,166,46,189,140,157,247,163,218,214,108,232,2,60,172,180,104,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
