It's almost as if Michelle has acoustically revisited the songs. 'Paper pieces' is just a different sounding song altogether that I've heard from her, very rock band sounding. Carrying on the cd you get into beautiful melodic songs such as 'Stewart's Coat', 'I'll always be right there' and 'Leap of faith' the guitar is prominent and vocals from Michelle are superb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc64cbbe0f76fcc14068cd745a4fd147b564705c","amp;dn":"Michelle+Branch+-+Broken+Bracelet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc64cbbe0f76fcc14068cd745a4fd147b564705c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,100,203,190,15,118,252,193,64,104,205,116,90,79,209,71,181,100,112,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
