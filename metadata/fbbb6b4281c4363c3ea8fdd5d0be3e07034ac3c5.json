It contains basic scientific information, yet is primarily geared toward practical processes and applications. Particular attention is given to the structure-property relationships in order to help understand the behaviour in processing and service. An entire chapter is devoted to the aqueous dispersions of fluoropolymers, their processing and applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbbb6b4281c4363c3ea8fdd5d0be3e07034ac3c5","amp;dn":"Technology+of+Fluoropolymers+-+Jiri+George+Drobny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbbb6b4281c4363c3ea8fdd5d0be3e07034ac3c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,187,107,66,129,196,54,60,62,168,253,213,208,190,62,7,3,74,195,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
