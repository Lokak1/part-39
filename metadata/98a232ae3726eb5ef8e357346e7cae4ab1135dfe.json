All the characters are anthropomorphic animals (female characters are often much more anthropomorphized, though it varies depending on the animal.), their specific species reflecting their personality and their part in the story. For example, nearly all the policemen are canid, usually German Shepherds, Bloodhounds, Foxes or Scottish Terriers.\n\nMore info @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksad\n\nm4rf!\n\nseed if you love it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98a232ae3726eb5ef8e357346e7cae4ab1135dfe","amp;dn":"%5Bm4rf%5D+Blacksad+-+All+%5BFUR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98a232ae3726eb5ef8e357346e7cae4ab1135dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,162,50,174,55,38,235,94,248,227,87,52,110,124,174,74,177,19,93,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
