When Rachel\n                bumps into an ex-juror, she is shocked to discover\n                that the woman had an affair with Nick in the middle\n                of a trial - and a desperately worried Nick does\n                everything in his power to persuade Rachel to keep\n                the knowledge to herself. After a current\n                investigation throws up similarities to Veronica's\n                murder, Janet tells Geoff Hastings that they could be\n                one step closer to bringing his sister's killer to\n                justice. But when Rachel stumbles across some new\n                facts in the case, she realises that Janet is in\n                terrible danger. Can she get the information to Janet\n                in time?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c25b2f011573efd3e3203a85d950c8e8f1c4c114","amp;dn":"Scott.And.Bailey.S01E05.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c25b2f011573efd3e3203a85d950c8e8f1c4c114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,91,47,1,21,115,239,211,227,32,58,133,217,80,200,232,241,196,193,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
