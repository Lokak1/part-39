When the group stray beyond the U-Mens monitoring systems one of their Cyborgs attacks with the \nintention of harvesting their organs and things look bad for the group until Hisako's powers activate and she becomes Armor. \nAfter defeating the cyborg, however, her power threatens to run out of control and only Emma Frosts telepathy can calm her \nand the X-Men then find and free more of the kidnapped mutants in another part of the lab.\n\n\nSpoken Language:- Japanese\n\nSubtitled Language\n=============================\n\nScreenshots\n-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\n[URL=http://img225.imageshack.us/i/xmenanime103awakeningen.jpg/][IMG]http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/3900/xmenanime103awakeningen.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n================================\n\nFile Info\n-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:29.776\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : DX50\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 42251\nVideoBitRate       : 901469\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat:- Divx AVI\n\n=============================\n\nHash\n-=-=-=-\n\nDF303BC038B96B49B126B020959C7BA1BF4F56CC\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df303bc038b96b49b126b020959c7ba1bf4f56cc","amp;dn":"X-Men%5Banime%5D-103-Awakening-Eng-Subs-Divx%5BBy-Oj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df303bc038b96b49b126b020959c7ba1bf4f56cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,48,59,192,56,185,107,73,177,38,176,32,149,156,123,161,191,79,86,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
