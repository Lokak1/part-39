When I went there in March of 2010 to attend a wedding my journey became a search for my family roots . THE IRAN I REMEMBER is the echo of this journey to a homeland that I left so many years ago. It is the search for my own past intertwined with the history, culture, and literature of Iran. - Written and Directed by Morteza Rezvani Feel free to convert the asf to mp4, update comments with your success in compression and conversion and share the program you used and options passed.\nEnglish Audio and Subtitle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e30a308606aaed0c43952b64b09a5d63552619b4","amp;dn":"The+Iran+I+Remember-LinkTV+asf+ptc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e30a308606aaed0c43952b64b09a5d63552619b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,10,48,134,6,170,237,12,67,149,43,100,176,154,93,99,85,38,25,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
