It was produced and directed by Bernard Vorhaus for Republic Pictures.\nRepublic Pictures spared no expense in making the film, with large numbers of costumed extras and recreations of Mardi Gras. The studio's high standard of action scenes and special effects miniatures come to the fore in the fight scenes and flood climax.\nThe film mixes the romance and action with a comedic touch, with Wayne performing a light, Walking Tall type scenario.\nA 1941 Time magazine review noted the similarities between Wayne's Thomas E. Dewey type character and Huey Long.\n\n    CAST:- \n    John Wayne as John Reynolds\n    Ona Munson as Julie Mirbeau\n    Ray Middleton as Blackburn &quot;Blackie&quot; Williams\n    Henry Stephenson as General Anatole Mirbeau\n    Helen Westley as Blanche Brunot\n    Jack Pennick as Cuffy Brown\n    Dorothy Dandridge as Felice\n    Shimen Ruskin as Gaston\n    Jacqueline Dalya as Pearl\n    Paul Scardon as Judge Wilson\n    Major James H.

The Lottery forces also have information sources in the State's Attorney's office that reveals every move Wayne has planned to raid illegal activities as well as corrupting judges and other officials through their brothels.\n\nThe battle between the two forces esclates leading into a climax of lightning striking and destroying a courthouse where a trial is going on and a break in the levees during torrential rains that flood the city.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 5947 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio:1.333:1\nFrames Per Second:29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 1:22:59\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bed6f91289d5ee0fa2ce559736e0712ab035707","amp;dn":"Lady+from+Louisiana+%281941%29+DVD5+-+%5B+DDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bed6f91289d5ee0fa2ce559736e0712ab035707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,237,111,145,40,157,94,224,250,44,229,89,115,110,7,18,171,3,87,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
