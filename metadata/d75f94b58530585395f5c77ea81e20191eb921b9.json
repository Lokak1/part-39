The remaining members, guitarist Stephen Egerton, bassist Karl Alvarez, and drummer Bill Stevenson decided to carry on as a band, adopting the title of the Descendents last studio album, All, as their official moniker.\n\nAllroys Revenge is the second album by the California pop punk band All, released in 1989 on Cruz Records. It was the first release with their second lead singer, Scott Reynolds.\n\nFLAC\ncredit: DeVOiD\n\nAll - Allroys Revenge\n 01 - gnutheme\n 02 - fool\n 03 - check one\n 04 - scary sad\n 05 - man-o-steel\n 06 - box\n 07 - copping z\n 08 - hot rod lincoln\n 09 - shes my ex\n 10 - bubble gum\n 11 - mary\n 12 - net\n 13 - no traffic\n 14 - carnage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d75f94b58530585395f5c77ea81e20191eb921b9","amp;dn":"All-Allroys_Revenge-CD-FLAC-1989-DeVOiD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d75f94b58530585395f5c77ea81e20191eb921b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,95,148,181,133,48,88,83,149,245,199,126,168,30,32,25,30,185,33,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
