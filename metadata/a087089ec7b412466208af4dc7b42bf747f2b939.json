In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Aston Walker - aka the Birmingham Looter - about whether he was ever offered a deferred prosecution agreement for his crime of looting during the 2011 riots and ask whether he would have been granted immunity had he offered the loot as an infinitely rehypothecated collateralized looted H&amp;M clothes bonds.\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
