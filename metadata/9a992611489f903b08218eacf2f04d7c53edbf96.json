For more than two decades, Barbara was always by his side, traveling the globe and hosting glittering events for their famous friends, including presidents, kings, queens, Hollywood royalty, and musical legends.  Among them were Sammy Davis, Jr., Princess Grace of Monaco, Bob Dylan, and Ronald Reagan.  Each night, as Frank publicly wooed his bride with love songs from a concert stage, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d fall in love with him all over again.\n From her own humble beginnings in a small town in Missouri to her time as a fashion model and her marriage to Zeppo Marx, Barbara Sinatra reveals a life lived with passion, conviction, and grace.  A founder of the Miss Universe pageant and a onetime Vegas showgirl, she raised her only son almost single-handedly in often dire circumstances until, after five years of tempestuous courtship, she and Frank committed to each other wholeheartedly.  In stories that leap off the page, she takes us behind the scenes of her iconic husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary career and paints an intimate portrait of a man who was variously generous, jealous, witty, and wicked.  Coupled with revealing insights about many of FrankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrated songs, this is much more than the story of a showbiz marriage. \nIt is a story of passion and of a deep and lifelong love.\n\nAbout Wendy Holden &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/8e/ac/ab623b0e45170ad8976f9b.L._V186783944_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/8e/ac/ab623b0e45170ad8976f9b.L._V186783944_.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \nWendy Holden, also known as Taylor Holden, is an experienced author and novelist with more than twenty books already published including a novel plus two screenplays.
