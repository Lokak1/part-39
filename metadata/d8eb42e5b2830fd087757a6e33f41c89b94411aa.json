This gives \r\na good speed improvement over the VS2008 version. \r\n\r\n- Asynchronous job search system. Instead of synchronously looking for a job, \r\nworkers, guards, prisoners, doctors now place a request for a new job in a \r\nqueue. This queue is processed during render phase of the game loop so \r\nshouldn't take up any time during the main game loop. \r\n\r\n- Speed up rendering of the Feed Prisoners Objective. This was particularly \r\nslow when their were a lot of hungry prisoners. \r\n\r\n- Rebuild the indoor/outdoor shadow mask only when a cell changes its material \r\nor indoor/outdoor status. \r\n\r\nThermodynamics (continued) \r\n\r\n- New pipe type in the utilities view: Hot water pipes \r\nThese operate on a seperate layer to the existing pipes, and can be overlaid without conflict. \r\n\r\n- New utility: Hot water boiler \r\nRequires a large pipe connection of cold water, and a direct electrical connection \r\nYou can run hot water pipes from this boiler in any direction. \r\nNb. Water will lose heat the further it gets from the boiler. \r\n\r\n- All radiators now require a hot water connection to function \r\n\r\n- Showers can take cold water or hot water. \r\nWhen supplied with hot water, showers will also reduce a prisoner's Warmth need \r\nWhen supplied only with cold water will apply a Frigid effect, which acts as a kind of short-term surpression \r\nwhile also spiking their Warmth and comfort needs. \r\n\r\n3d mode has been discovered \r\n\r\nThis update we have improved 3d mode with new shapes, new shaders operating on all objects, and better wall geometry. \r\n3d mode remains very experimental. \r\n\r\nKnown bug: The mouse position is wrong when using graphics/Supersampling. \r\nKnown bug: Long pauses caused by geometry changing, eg wall construction/demolition \r\n\r\nBUG FIXES \r\n\r\n- Thermodynamic map to use 16 bit number type to represent the temperature \r\ninstead of 8 bit. This fixes a bug with fire showing negative temperatures. \r\n\r\n- 0010610: [Graphics] entire screen is black and white boxes\r\n\r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen Prison Architect Update 5b.exe , wait for a bit for the self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the game folder, open the extracted folder and play.....\r\nOR\r\nExtarct it yourself using 'WinRAR'\r\n\r\nAlways open the game using run as administrator\r\n\r\nCheck my FB page for more :\r\nMr DJ repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8eb42e5b2830fd087757a6e33f41c89b94411aa","amp;dn":"Prison+Architect+Update+5b+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8eb42e5b2830fd087757a6e33f41c89b94411aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,235,66,229,178,131,15,208,135,117,122,110,51,244,28,137,185,68,17,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
