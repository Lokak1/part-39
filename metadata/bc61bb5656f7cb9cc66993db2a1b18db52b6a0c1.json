Starring the voice talent of stand-up comedian Harland Williams.\n\nYoung Ned Flemkin gets his allowance and decides to buy the best pet a boy could ever have.  When $1.65 doesn&amp;#039;t seem to be enough to afford an elephant, Ned settles for a sleepy blue newt and names him Newton.  However, Newton turns out to be a very boring pet so the pet shop owner suggests &quot;Zippo for Newt&quot; pet food to perk the little guy up, but DON&amp;#039;T GIVE HIM TOO MUCH!\n\nAs it turns out, eating too much Zippo has the unusual effect of transforming Newton into an enormous, shape-shifting, wise-cracking monstrosity, and a source of never-ending trouble for Ned.  But at the same time, Newton really does become the best pet a boy could ever have.\n\n&quot;Don&amp;#039;t buy a reliable, devoted newt! Oh, no! Get one of these indifferent, rat-dragging, sofa-shredders who&amp;#039;ll fill the catbox just as you&amp;#039;re having breakfast! Yum!
