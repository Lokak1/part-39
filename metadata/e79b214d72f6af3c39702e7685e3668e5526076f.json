Odd never \nasked to communicate with the dead?it&amp;#039;s something that just happened. But \nas the unofficial goodwill ambassador between our world and theirs, he&amp;#039;s got \na duty to do the right thing. That&amp;#039;s the way Odd sees it and that&amp;#039;s why he&amp;#039;s \nwon hearts on both sides of the divide between life and death.\n\nNow a childhood friend of Odd&amp;#039;s has disappeared. The worst is feared. But as \nOdd applies his unique talents to the task of finding the missing person, he \ndiscovers something worse than a dead body, encounters an enemy of \nexceptional cunning, and spirals into a vortex of terror.\n\nWhether you&amp;#039;re meeting Odd Thomas for the first time or he&amp;#039;s already an old \nfriend, you&amp;#039;ll be led on an unforgettable journey through a world of terror, \nwonder and delight?to a revelation that can change your life.
