The four Eli Young Band members came together purely by chance as students the University of North Texas in Denton, where roommates Mike Eli and James Young found an instant and intense shared musical sensibility. For frontman Eli, the wildfire success of the band is undeniable musical proof that some of the best things in life are just meant to be. The duo, originally known as Eli &amp; Young, mixed their newly penned songs with covers from musical heroes like Rodney Crowell and Paul Simon and started playing regular gigs at a local dive known as the R Bar. That sleepy venue was soon alive with a full house and a full band when next-door college roommates Chris Thompson and Jon Jones joined on drums and bass respectively.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0821f45884eb81006bfc7dec258a5a78aa3548a6","amp;dn":"Eli+Young+Band+-+Jet+Black+%26amp%3B+Jealous+%5B2008%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0821f45884eb81006bfc7dec258a5a78aa3548a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,33,244,88,132,235,129,0,107,252,125,236,37,138,90,120,170,53,72,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
