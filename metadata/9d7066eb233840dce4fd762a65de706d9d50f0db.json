(I consider Joni Mitchell's &quot;Car on the Hill&quot; from Court and Spark to be a companion piece about sitting in the Hollywood Hills, waiting for somebody to show up.) And although the goofy TV movie may have been mostly Paul's baby, this album features the two 45 rpm masterpieces that sum up the quintessential best of Lennon and McCartney at this stage of their development: Paul's &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and John's &quot;I Am the Walrus.&quot; --Jim Emerson\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Magical mystery tour                                 [02:50]\n02.The fool on the hill                                 [02:59]\n03.Flying                                               [02:16]\n04.Blue jay way                                         [03:55]\n05.Your mother should know                              [02:28]\n06.I am the walrus                                      [04:36]\n07.Hello goodbye                                        [03:29]\n08.Strawberry fields forever                            [04:07]\n09.Penny lane                                           [03:01]\n10.Baby you're A rich man                               [03:01]\n11.All you need is love                                 [03:50]\n____\n\n36:32 min\n 53,5 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
