They were a particularly lazy and not terribly bright species that lived a long time ago and vanished without a trace. They were invited by God to be the chosen two to continue their race after the great flood. The story follows them from the time they get invited aboard Noah's Ark, all the way up to the moment they finally arrive at the boat... only to realize that they're late and have been locked out! When it starts to rain, they are left to realize that they've literally missed the boat on survival, and have doomed their entire species to extinction! Engagingly written with wonderfully vibrant art, this story will delight readers of all ages and, if you're not looking, may even teach a lesson about procrastination and slothfulness.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67653fa4cd279aed755a8f73f5641cc7172adeec","amp;dn":"Missing+The+Boat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67653fa4cd279aed755a8f73f5641cc7172adeec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,101,63,164,205,39,154,237,117,90,143,115,245,100,28,199,23,42,222,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
