I love the story that Prince Buster was security for Coxsone DoddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœDownbeatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sound system. He was hired because he was a boxer. If anybody wanted to smash CoxsoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound system, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to get through Prince Buster first. He was super influential with the 2 Tone movement Ã¢â‚¬â€ Madness Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Step BeyondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“MadnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, are Prince Buster Songs, plus The Specials- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enjoy YourselfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Judge DreadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Al CaponeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, to name a fewÃ¢â‚¬â€œand weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thirty Pieces Of SilverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n \nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar, Vocals\nJ Bonner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\nDan Boer- Organ\nScott Abels Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\nJohn Morrical -Piano\nMike Bolger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Horns\nPablo Calogero- Sax\nKevin Bivona- BG vocal\nAimee Interrupter -BG Vocal\nJordis Unga Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BG Vocal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37a54d2569269581be8d3cbd6ec0fcb105e7f0a0","amp;dn":"Thirty+Pieces+Of+Silver+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37a54d2569269581be8d3cbd6ec0fcb105e7f0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,165,77,37,105,38,149,129,190,141,60,189,110,192,252,177,5,231,240,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
