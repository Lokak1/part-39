Having just graduated from college, a bee by the name of Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) finds himself disillusioned with the prospect of having only one career choice - honey. As he ventures outside of the hive for the first time, he breaks one of the cardinal rules of the bee world and talks to a human, a New York City florist named Vanessa (RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Zellweger). He is shocked to discover that the humans have been stealing and eating the bee's honey for centuries. He ultimately realizes that his true calling in life is to set the world right by suing the human race. That is until the ensuing chaos upsets the very balance of nature. It is up to Barry to prove that even a little bee can spell big changes in the world.\n\nGenre: Animation | Comedy | Family | Fantasy\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f75acd93e0f4b66c93a9fab16b6287de6a3c0d8a","amp;dn":"Bee+Movie.1080p.AC+3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ra+y.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f75acd93e0f4b66c93a9fab16b6287de6a3c0d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,90,205,147,224,244,182,108,147,169,250,177,107,98,135,222,106,60,13,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
