After study in Nigeria and the UK, he worked with the Royal Court Theatre in London. He went on to write plays that were produced in both countries, in theatres and on radio. He took an active role in Nigeria's political history and its struggle for independence from Great Britain. In 1965, he seized the Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service studio and broadcast a demand for the cancellation of the Western Nigeria Regional Elections. In 1967 during the Nigerian Civil War, he was arrested by the federal government of General Yakubu Gowon and put in solitary confinement for two years.\n\nSoyinka has strongly criticised many Nigerian military dictators, especially late General Sanni Abacha, as well as other political tyrannies, including the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. Much of his writing has been concerned with &quot;the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it&quot;. During the regime of General Sani Abacha (1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œ98), Soyinka escaped from Nigeria via the &quot;Nadeco Route&quot; on a motorcycle. Living abroad, mainly in the United States, he was a professor first at Cornell University and then at Emory University in Atlanta, where in 1996 he was appointed Robert W. Woodruff Professor of the Arts. Abacha proclaimed a death sentence against him &quot;in absentia&quot;. With civilian rule restored to Nigeria in 1999, Soyinka returned to his nation. He has also taught at the universities of Oxford, Harvard and Yale.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1999, he was a Professor of Comparative Literature at the Obafemi Awolowo University, then called the University of Ife. With civilian rule restored in 1999, he was made professor emeritus. Soyinka has been a Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In the fall of 2007 he was appointed Professor in Residence at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, US.\n\n\nThe torrent contains:\n\n* Memoir -- You Must Set Forth at Dawn (2006) -- ePUB\n\n* Essays -- A Climate of Fear (originally held as the BBC Reid Lectures 2004, audio and transcripts) -- ePUB\n\n\n\nRead the following article, interviews, check out the websites, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wole_Soyinka&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wole_Soyinka&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thisislime.net/interviews/theatre/An_exclusive_interview_with_Professor_Wole_Soyinka&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thisislime.net/interviews/theatre/An_exclusive_interview_with_Professor_Wole_Soyinka&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/9600954/Wole-Soyinka-If-religion-was-taken-away-Id-be-happy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/9600954/Wole-Soyinka-If-religion-was-taken-away-Id-be-happy.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1986/soyinka-bio.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1986/soyinka-bio.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd1fe8c5c167d4e37a88e5aeeeb00b9f7ad6f4a","amp;dn":"Wole+Soyinka+-+Nobel+Prize+in+Literature+1986+%282+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd1fe8c5c167d4e37a88e5aeeeb00b9f7ad6f4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,209,254,140,92,22,125,78,55,168,142,90,238,235,0,185,247,173,111,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
