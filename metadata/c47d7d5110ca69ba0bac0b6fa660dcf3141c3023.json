The first two chapters show how the ancient calculations of practical problems led to infinite series, differential and integral calculus and to differential equations. The establishment of mathematical rigour for these subjects in the 19th century for one and several variables is treated in chapters III and IV. Many quotations are included to give the flavor of the history. The text is complemented by a large number of examples, calculations and mathematical pictures and will provide stimulating and enjoyable reading for students, teachers, as well as researchers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c47d7d5110ca69ba0bac0b6fa660dcf3141c3023","amp;dn":"Analysis+by+its+history+-+Ernst+Hairer%2C+Gerhard+Wanner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c47d7d5110ca69ba0bac0b6fa660dcf3141c3023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,125,125,81,16,202,105,186,11,172,11,111,166,96,220,243,20,28,48,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
