She was four years old. Marina Chapman was stolen from her housing estate and then abandoned deep in the Colombian jungle. That she survived is a miracle. Two days later, half-drugged, terrified, and starving, she came upon a troop of capuchin monkeys. Acting entirely on instinct, she tried to do what they did: she ate what they ate and copied their actions, and little by little, learned to fend for herself.\n\nSo begins the story of her five years among the monkeys, during which time she gradually became feral; she lost the ability to speak, lost all inhibition, lost any real sense of being human, replacing the structure of human society with the social mores of her new simian family. But society was eventually to reclaim her. At age ten she was discovered by a pair of hunters who took her to the lawless Colombian city of Cucuta where, in exchange for a parrot, they sold her to a brothel. When she learned that she was to be groomed for prostitution, she made her plans to escape. But her adventure wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t over yet...\n\nIn the vein of &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; and &quot;City of God,&quot; this rousing story of a lost child who overcomes the dangers of the wild and the brutality of the streets to finally reclaim her life will astonish readers everywhere.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a17dfcf2266ac4e3f74dfb9b3ce9f1e5ade6cff7","amp;dn":"The+Girl+With+No+Name+by+Marina+Chapman+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a17dfcf2266ac4e3f74dfb9b3ce9f1e5ade6cff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,125,252,242,38,106,196,227,247,77,251,155,60,233,241,229,173,230,207,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
