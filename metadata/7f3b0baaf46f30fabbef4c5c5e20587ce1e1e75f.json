A move that brings her back into the tempting arms of Frankie Falcone, the ex that never fails to make her heart sit up and beg. When Lucie parlays her temporary dog-walking gig into a career making fancy dog accessories, Frankie becomes her number one supporter. Life starts to look like a walk in the park...until three of her bling-wearing clients are dogjacked. Despite help from the on-again, off-again Mr. Fix-It in her life, Lucie is thrown into an investigation that's more Goodfellas than good doggie. One that could shatter her new life and her second chance at love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f3b0baaf46f30fabbef4c5c5e20587ce1e1e75f","amp;dn":"%5BLucie+Rizzo+Adventure+01%5D+Dog+Collar+Crime+by+Adrienne+Giordano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f3b0baaf46f30fabbef4c5c5e20587ce1e1e75f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,59,11,170,244,111,48,250,187,239,76,92,94,32,88,124,225,225,231,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
