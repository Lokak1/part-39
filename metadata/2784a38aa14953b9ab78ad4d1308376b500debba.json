News\nand information about the war - in all it's\nramifications - was brought home with the\nrawness and immmediacy of these original\nreports.\nThis unique chronicle of war recordings,\npreserved for over 40 years, is both a\ntestament to the BBC War Correspondents and\na rare document in history.\n\nUploader's note\nA double cassette audo book featuring 127 clips\nspread over 4 sides and around 2 hours long.\nMy inlay card for this is in bad condition.\nCompletely unfolded it reveals 8 sides of text\nwhich includes a list of the 127 clips,\ndivided into the 4 sides with a line or two\nof information about each clip.\nBrings back memories of vinyl LP liner notes!\nI thought the best way to include the whole\ninlay was to scan the 8 sides of text along\nwith it's outside front and back.\nThen make a .pdf layed out in order to read\nfrom start to end.\nBut as I said the inlay is in bad condition.\nI actually used 'Paint' on some areas!\nSometimes this was to tidy it up and\nothers because I had to fill in missing areas!\nThere might be some parts of the text that\nprove difficult to read.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2784a38aa14953b9ab78ad4d1308376b500debba","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+Collection+The+Second+World+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2784a38aa14953b9ab78ad4d1308376b500debba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,132,163,138,161,73,83,185,171,120,173,77,19,8,55,107,80,13,235,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
