No mom, no dad, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing for him at the group home but therapy. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t belong at the beach where he works either, unless he finds a reason to stay. Olivia is blond hair, blue eyes, rich dad. The prettiest girl in Cardiff. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hiding something from Kidd Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but could they ever be together anyway? Devon is mean, mysterious, and driven by a death wish. A best friend and worst enemy. He followed Kidd all the way to the beach and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not leaving until he teaches him a few lessons about life. And Olivia.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Henry Levya.\n\n----------------------\nVisit us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n----------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55e5bb094d2e0ec66aa4d785be2075ff5fb4b8b","amp;dn":"I+Will+Save+You+-+Matt+de+la+Pena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55e5bb094d2e0ec66aa4d785be2075ff5fb4b8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,94,91,176,148,210,224,236,102,170,77,120,91,226,7,95,245,251,75,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
