It never has been. It never will be. Doubt everything. John Stossel does. A self-described skeptic, he has dismantled societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sacred cows with unerring common sense. Now he debunks the most sacred of them all: our intuition and belief that government can solve our problems. In No, They CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, the New York Times bestselling author and Fox News commentator insists that we discard that idea of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“perfectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ governmentÃ¢â‚¬â€left or rightÃ¢â‚¬â€and retrain our brain to look only at the facts, to rethink our lives as independent individualsÃ¢â‚¬â€and fast. \nWith characteristic tenacity, John Stossel outlines and exposes the fallacies and facts of the most pressing issues of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social and political climateÃ¢â‚¬â€and shows how our intuitions about them are, frankly, wrong: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the unreliable marriage between big business, the media, and unions \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the myth of tax breaks and the ignorance of their advocates \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ why Ã¢â‚¬Å“central plannersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ never create more jobs and how government never really will \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ why free trade worksÃ¢â‚¬â€without government Interference \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ federal regulations and the trouble they create for consumers \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the harm caused to the disabled by government protection of the disabled \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the problems (social and economic) generated by minimum-wage laws \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the destructive daydreams of Ã¢â‚¬Å“health insurance for everyoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ bad food vs. good food and the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intrusive, unwelcome nanny sensibilities \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the dumbing down of public education and teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unions \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ how gun control actually increases crime \n\n. . . and more myth-busting realities of why the American people must wrest our lives back from a government stranglehold. \n\nStossel also reveals how his unyielding desire to educate the public with the truth caused an irreparable rift with ABC (nobody wanted to hear the point-by- point facts of ObamaCare), and why he left his long-running stint for a new, uncensored forum with Fox. He lays out his ideas for education innovation as well and, finally, makes it perfectly clear why government action is the least effective and desirable fantasy to hang on to. As Stossel says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about electing the right people. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about narrowing responsibilities.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ No, They CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t is an irrefutable first step toward that goal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382f115e75d39bb6533e97c1ea1e71dc717dc3f1","amp;dn":"John+Stossel+-+No+They+Cant+Why+Government+Fails+%5B128%5D+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382f115e75d39bb6533e97c1ea1e71dc717dc3f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,47,17,94,117,211,155,182,83,62,151,193,234,30,113,220,113,125,195,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
