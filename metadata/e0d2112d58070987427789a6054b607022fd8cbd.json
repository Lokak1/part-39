Hannigan also worked with Rice on his latest album, &amp;#039;9&amp;#039;, singing the lead vocal on the album&amp;#039;s first single and opening song, &amp;#039;9 Crimes&amp;#039;.\n\nShe has also been involved with many side projects in the Irish music scene, contributing backing vocals to &amp;#039;Sideways Down&amp;#039; on The Frames&amp;#039; &amp;#039;Burn the Maps&amp;#039; and Mic Christopher&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;What a Curious Notion&amp;#039; for his posthumous debut, &amp;#039;Skylarkin&amp;#039;. She performed on the soundtrack for the Irish film &amp;#039;Goldfish Memory&amp;#039;, with Rice, and played a large role on &amp;#039;The Cake Sale&amp;#039; charity album in aid of a cause close to her heart, Ireland&amp;#039;s Make Trade Fair campaign. An outing at last year&amp;#039;s Electric Picnic and a recent tour with Snow Patrol has seen Hannigan develop more of a solo presence on the Irish music scene. 2007 could be her year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0d2112d58070987427789a6054b607022fd8cbd","amp;dn":"Lisa+Hannigan+-+RTE+Other+Voices+5%2C+Programme+5+-+28+February+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0d2112d58070987427789a6054b607022fd8cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,210,17,45,88,7,9,135,66,119,137,166,5,75,96,112,34,253,140,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
