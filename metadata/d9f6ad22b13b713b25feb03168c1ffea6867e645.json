Mantronix\nunderwent several genre (and line / up) changes during its 7-year existence (1984 /1991),\nfrom old school hip hop to electro funk to house music, but the group is primarily remembered\nfor its original, heavily synthesized blend of old school hip-hop and electro funk.\n\nThat's My Beat is a compilation album by hip hop/electo funk musician, Kurtis Mantronik and\nfeatures tracks selected by Mantronik and cited as influences to his work with his hip hop /\nelectro funk group Mantronix.
