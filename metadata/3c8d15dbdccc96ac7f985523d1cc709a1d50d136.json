His world revolves around a doting mother, a passion for music and the memories of a childhood friend, Sameer, who left Goa for Mumbai many years ago and hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t replied to his frequent letters ever since. PintoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talent for music is only matched by his knack for finding trouble in the unlikeliest of places often resulting in the most outlandish and hilarious situations. When PintoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s idyllic world is shattered by the sudden demise of his mother he decides to head to Mumbai in search of the only friend he knows. Will Pinto find Sameer or will trouble find him first?
