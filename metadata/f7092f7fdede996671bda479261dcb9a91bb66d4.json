Unzip but do not install\n         \n         2. 2-click on \\&quot;SW1EPRCR\\&quot; icon to launch game from stored location\n\nThere are other (more complicated) ways to use this but the above method works fine and all the save files etc work.\n\nNotes: 1. This game does not work on one of my PCs (a newer one) probably due to bios settings \n\n       2. Messing with the sound settings may cause a crash! (program crash)\n\n           \nEnjoy this superb game!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7092f7fdede996671bda479261dcb9a91bb66d4","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Episode+1+Racer+%28Pod+Racer%29.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7092f7fdede996671bda479261dcb9a91bb66d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,9,47,127,222,222,153,102,113,189,164,121,38,29,203,154,145,187,102,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
