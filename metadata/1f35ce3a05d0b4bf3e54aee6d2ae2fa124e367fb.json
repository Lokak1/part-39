A True Story of Loss, Survival and Rescue at Sea by Michael Schumacher\n\nOn November 18, 1958, a 623-foot limestone carrier - caught in one of the most violent storms in Lake Michigan history - broke in two and sank in less than five minutes. Four of the 35-person crew escaped to a small raft, to which they clung in total darkness, braving 30-foot waves and frigid temperatures. \n\nAs the storm raged on, a search-and-rescue mission hunted for survivors, while the frantic citizens of nearby Rogers City, Michigan, the hardscrabble town that was home to 26 members of the Carl D. Bradley's crew, anxiously awaited word of their loved ones' fates. In Wreck of the Carl D., Michael Schumacher reconstructs the terrible accident, perilous search, and chilling aftermath for the small Michigan town so intimately affected by the tragedy.\n\nMeet the Author:\n\nMichael Schumacher is author of nine books, including Francis Ford Coppola, There but for Fortune, Crossroads, Dharma Lion, and The Mighty Fitz.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | History | Nautical Disasters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f35ce3a05d0b4bf3e54aee6d2ae2fa124e367fb","amp;dn":"Wreck+of+the+Carl+D.+by+Michael+Schumacher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f35ce3a05d0b4bf3e54aee6d2ae2fa124e367fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,53,206,58,5,208,180,191,62,84,174,230,210,174,47,161,36,227,103,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
