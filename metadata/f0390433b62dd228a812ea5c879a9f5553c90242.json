The compilation features all of the band's 12 music videos from their first four albums, from &quot;What Would You Say&quot; to &quot;The Space Between&quot;, with the earliest released in 1995, contrary to the compilation's title. Each video features a Dolby Digital stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix, as well as an audio commentary by the video's director. The compilation also features a behind-the-scenes documentary for &quot;Don't Drink the Water&quot;, &quot;Stay (Wasting Time)&quot;, and &quot;I Did It&quot;.\n\nDave Matthews Band (often abbreviated to DMB) is an American rock band that was formed in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991. The founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, drummer/backing vocalist Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Boyd Tinsley was added to the band as a violinist soon after the band was formed. Moore died suddenly in August 2008 due to complications from injuries sustained in an ATV accident. Grammy Award-winner Jeff Coffin of BÃƒÂ©la Fleck and the Flecktones has since filled Moore's spot as the band's saxophonist. Rashawn Ross and Tim Reynolds have also become full time touring members of the band. The band's 2009 album Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (the first album since Moore's death) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning the band their fifth consecutive number one debut. Their most recent album, Away from the World, released in 2012, debuted at number one on the Billboard chart Ã¢â‚¬â€ making them the only group to have six consecutive studio albums debut in the top spot. As of 2010, the Dave Matthews Band has sold over 30 million records worldwide.\n\nThe band is known for their annual summer-long tours of the United States and Europe, featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs, accompanied by an elaborate video and lighting show. The band is known for playing the songs differently each time. This portion of the tour has become a stamp of DMB and has grown with the band since Fenton Williams began working with them in the early 1990s. After twenty consecutive years of touring the band announced that it would take the summer of 2011 off.\n\nIn April 2014, DMB is scheduled to perform in Australia at the West Coast Blues N Roots Festival and the Byron Bay Bluesfest.\n\nIn November 2013, Matthews announced that a new album was in the works. The record will be produced by Rob Cavallo.\n(video do not have any logos)\n\n\n\nDave Matthews Band - The Videos 1994Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001 [Promo Music Video VOB's] folder contains:\n\n1.
