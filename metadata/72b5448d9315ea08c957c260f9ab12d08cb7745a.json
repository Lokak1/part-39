Armed with ancient Teslamancer technology and your own ingenuity and creativity, your path lies through the decrepit Tesla Tower and beyond.\nComplex puzzles! Put your sense of logic to the test and cleverly manipulate the world around you using electricity and magnetism, the lifeblood of the game. Puzzles will range from Ã¢â‚¬Å“pff, that wasn't so badÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to keyboard-smashing, controller-chewing frustration.\nExplore!

Tired of all those words in your video games? Have no fear, Teslagrad features not a single snippet of text or squeak of dialogue. Everything is purely visual, and the entire story is told through what you see (and sometimes what you don't see).\nSteampunk powered! Discover a dystopic and mind-blowing rainy-and-brainy setting, presenting a steampunk vision of an old Europe-inspired new world.\nOld-school boss fights! Use your skills and wits to overcome the 5 incredible final bosses eager to demagnetize you.\nNo disruptions! That means no loading screens, no GUI, no cutscenes. Just the game and you.\nMesmerizing soundtrack!
