KaluzaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Klein theory didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t generate enough interest with physicist for the next five decades, due to its problems with inconsistencies. With the advent of supergravity theory (the theory that unifies general relativity and supersymmetry theories) in late 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and eventually, string theories (1980s) and M-theory (1990s), the dimensions of space-time increased to 11 (10-space and 1-time dimension).\n\nThere are two main features in this book that differentiates it from other books written about extra dimensions: The first feature is the coverage of extra dimensions in time (Two Time physics), which has not been covered in earlier books about extra dimensions. All other books mainly cover extra spatial dimensions. The second feature deals with level of presentation. The material is presented in a non-technical language followed by additional sections (in the form of appendices or footnotes) that explain the basic equations and formulas in the theories. This feature is very attractive to readers who want to find out more about the theories involved beyond the basic description for a layperson. The text is designed for scientifically literate non-specialists who want to know the latest discoveries in theoretical physics in a non-technical language. Readers with basic undergraduate background in modern physics and quantum mechanics can easily understand the technical sections.\n\nPart I starts with an overview of the Standard Model of particles and forces, notions of EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s special and general relativity, and the overall view of the universe from the Big Bang to the present epoch, and covers Two-Time physics. 2T-physics has worked correctly at all scales of physics, both macroscopic and microscopic, for which there is experimental data so far. In addition to revealing hidden information even in familiar &quot;everyday&quot; physics, it also makes testable predictions in lesser known physics regimes that could be analyzed at the energy scales of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or in cosmological observations.&quot;\n\nPart II of the book is focused on extra dimensions of space. It covers the following topics: The Popular View of Extra Dimensions, Einstein and the Fourth Dimension, Traditional Extra Dimensions, Einstein's Gravity, The Theory Formerly Known as String, Warped Extra Dimensions, and How Do We Look For Extra Dimensions?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b602b40ae04fcd1e737d43979ab7ad2216f38ad","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Extra+Dimensions+in+Space+and+Time+%28Multiversal+Jou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b602b40ae04fcd1e737d43979ab7ad2216f38ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,96,43,64,174,4,252,209,231,55,212,57,121,171,122,210,33,111,56,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
