The Williams brothers and their mate Jim Goodwin first had a hit with the disco-charged &quot;Ain't No Love (Ain't No Use)&quot;, but disillusionment with the Manchester scene set in, so they picked up guitars and formed Doves--a band determined to infuse raw emotion into music. From instrumental opener &quot;Firesuite&quot;--which showcases their rumbling, restrained guitar firepower--to the tumbling acoustic shanty &quot;Sea Song&quot;, the Latin guitar lines of &quot;The Man Who Told Everything&quot;, the balmy Technique-era New Order rocker &quot;Catch The Sun&quot; and the aqueous, soaring &quot;Rise&quot;, none of the album's 11 tracks bear any real resemblance to each other. Doves have produced an outstanding debut album in Lost Souls, alternately melancholy and uplifting, sparkling darkly with charged atmospherics.\n\n1.\t&quot;Firesuite&quot;  \t4:36\n2.\t&quot;Here It Comes&quot;  \t4:50\n3.\t&quot;Break Me Gently&quot;  \t4:38\n4.\t&quot;Sea Song&quot;  \t6:12\n5.\t&quot;Rise&quot;  \t5:38\n6.\t&quot;Lost Souls&quot;  \t6:09\n7.\t&quot;Melody Calls&quot;  \t3:27\n8.\t&quot;Catch the Sun&quot;  \t4:49\n9.\t&quot;The Man Who Told Everything&quot;  \t5:47\n10.\t&quot;The Cedar Room&quot;  \t7:38\n11.\t&quot;Reprise&quot;  \t1:45\n12.\t&quot;A House&quot;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b8363281923b0c6b8073d9495b3ee8cf7167bb","amp;dn":"Doves+-+Lost+Souls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b8363281923b0c6b8073d9495b3ee8cf7167bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,184,54,50,129,146,59,12,107,128,115,217,73,91,62,232,207,113,103,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
