Single,in his forties, and poor, Dr. Aira is a skeptic. His personality Ã¢â‚¬â€ his weaknesses,whims, and pet peeves Ã¢â‚¬â€ is summed up in a series of digressions and regressions but he has a very special gift for miracles. He no longer cares about miracles,however, and has no faith in them. Perhaps he is even a little ashamed about his supernatural powers. Such is Dr. Aira, who also has to confront his arch-enemyÃ¢â‚¬â€ chief of the PiÃƒÂ±ero Hospital, Dr. Actyn Ã¢â‚¬â€ who is constantly trying to prove that Dr. Aira is a charlatan. Poor Dr. Aira is indeed a worker of miracles, but CÃƒÂ©sar Aira Ã¢â‚¬â€ the magesterial author Ã¢â‚¬â€ sends the very human doctor stumbling toward the biggest trap of all, in this magical book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38292f27998814e4d6c3737bd373afab61c7685c","amp;dn":"The+Miracle+Cures+of+Dr.+Aira","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38292f27998814e4d6c3737bd373afab61c7685c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,41,47,39,153,136,20,228,214,195,115,123,211,115,175,171,97,199,104,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
