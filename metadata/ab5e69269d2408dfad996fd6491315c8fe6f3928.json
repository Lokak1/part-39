From the moment they draw their initial breath - itself an incredibly complicated biological feat - to their first steps, it's a year of remarkable development.\n\nIn The Science of Babies, Nat Geo explores the amazing biomechanical benchmarks achieved in the first 12 months of human life. Using CGI, fMRI and other tools, viewers can watch as a baby's lungs draw breath for the first time, and can witness the heart grow exponentially in order to power this incredible developing creature. Perhaps even more fascinating is the manner in which the neurosynapses develop, creating the essence of what will become a new personality and intellect. This film explores the amazing mechanics behind the initial milestones in a human infant's life, and even compares them to babies of other species.\n\nBeyond simply being a beautiful film to watch, the technology that Nat Geo uses to help tell the tale is remarkable.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 4005 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:50:21\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1488.64 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: HDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5e69269d2408dfad996fd6491315c8fe6f3928","amp;dn":"HDTV+National+Geographic+Science+of+Babies+720p+Xvid+mp3+www+mvg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5e69269d2408dfad996fd6491315c8fe6f3928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,94,105,38,157,36,8,223,173,153,111,214,73,19,21,200,254,111,57,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
