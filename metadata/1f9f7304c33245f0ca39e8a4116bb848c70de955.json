It ended after the fall of the Soviet Union and the failure of its last mission to Mars in 1996. Soviet Robots in the Solar System chronicles the scientific and engineering accomplishments of this enterprise from its infancy to its demise. Each flight campaign is set into context of national politics and international competition with the United States.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f9f7304c33245f0ca39e8a4116bb848c70de955","amp;dn":"Soviet+Robots+in+the+Solar+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f9f7304c33245f0ca39e8a4116bb848c70de955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,159,115,4,195,50,69,240,202,57,232,164,17,107,184,72,199,13,233,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
