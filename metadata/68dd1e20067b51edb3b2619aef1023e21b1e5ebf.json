That\\&amp;#039;s why we&amp;#039;ve chosen this as a topic for our first training DVD. The DVD consists of two main parts: the first part will take you through creating a stylish glass vase by starting with the modeling and finishing off the final render in Photoshop. In part two you will learn how to model, texture, animate and render a bike wheel and how to use XPresso and Sketch &amp; Toon to take it even further. We\\&amp;#039;ve also included all the project files and a few extra goodies on the DVD.\n\nThe projects are aimed at intermediate to advanced users of CINEMA 4D. We\\&amp;#039;ve worked hard to give you the highest possible video and audio quality to make sure you won\\&amp;#039;t miss a single thing. The video is presented with a lossless codec at a resolution of 1024x768 pixels.\n\nThe projects make use of the Advanced Render and Sketch &amp; Toon modules but even if you only own the core package of CINEMA 4D Release 9 you will still be able to work through the projects.\n\nThe tutorials are co-presented by Matthew O\\&amp;#039;Neill and Janine Pauke. In total, the videos are just under 4 hours long.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dvd.3dfluff.com/vol1_1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dvd.3dfluff.com/vol1_1.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68dd1e20067b51edb3b2619aef1023e21b1e5ebf","amp;dn":"3D+Fluff+Training+for+CINEMA+4D+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68dd1e20067b51edb3b2619aef1023e21b1e5ebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,221,30,32,6,123,81,237,179,178,97,154,239,16,35,226,27,30,94,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
