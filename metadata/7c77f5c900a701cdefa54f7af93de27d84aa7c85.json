The club, whose members were all murdered, gathers outside the Castle and Falcon, the local pub that Philip's family owns and lives above. Philip's father tells him that Uncle Alan killed him and he must avenge his death. When Philip realizes that Uncle Alan has designs on his mom and the family pub, Philip decides that something must be done. But it's a much bigger job than he anticipated, especially when he is caught up by the usual distractions of childhood -- a pretty girl, wayward friends, school bullies, and his own self-doubt.\n\nThe Dead Fathers Club is a riveting, imaginative, and quirky update of Shakespeare's great tragedy that will establish Matt Haig as a young writer of great talent and imagination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c77f5c900a701cdefa54f7af93de27d84aa7c85","amp;dn":"The+Dead+Fathers+Club+by+Matt+Haig+%28EPUB+MOBI+AZW3+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c77f5c900a701cdefa54f7af93de27d84aa7c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,119,245,201,0,167,1,205,239,165,79,122,249,61,226,125,132,170,124,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
