So you can spend less time sorting and refining photographs, and more time actually shooting them. Its clean, elegant interface literally steps out of the way and lets you quickly view and work with the images you shot today, as well as the thousands of images that you will shoot over the course of your career. Because no two photographers work alike, Adobe Lightroom adapts to your workflow, not the other way around. \nLightroom lets you view, zoom in, and compare photographs quickly and easily. Precise, photography-specific adjustments allow you to fine tune your images while maintaining the highest level of image quality from capture through output. And best of all, it runs on most commonly used computers, even notebook computers used on location\n\nI know 1.4 is they newest build u can just download the updates when u load the program\n\nScanned with Kaspersky - Clean\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b5fb813b610f4ea24791e5e22a519ecd39eaa3","amp;dn":"Adobe+Lightroom+1.3+Portable.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b5fb813b610f4ea24791e5e22a519ecd39eaa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,181,251,129,59,97,15,78,162,71,145,229,226,42,81,158,205,57,234,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
