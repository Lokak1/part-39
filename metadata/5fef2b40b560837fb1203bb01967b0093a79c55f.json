Jimmy creates his own kids' party menu. When it comes to\n      making fish fingers, a power saw is Jimmy's choice as he works\n      out how the food factories try to make frozen fish taste as good\n      as fresh. Jimmy also makes pink, fluffy marshmallows. But\n      there's nothing very pink or fluffy about the ingredients which\n      include pig skin and trotters. He also visits a factory where\n      they produce fifteen thousand mini rolls an hour to discover how\n      they roll them all without cracks. Jimmy meets a raspberry\n      grower who wants to reduce the amount of pesticide he uses to\n      protect his delicate crop from bugs. So what's a huge hair dryer\n      got to do with it?\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
