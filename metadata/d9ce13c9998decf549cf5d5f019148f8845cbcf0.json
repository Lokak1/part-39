This book is neither. James Kahler has given his readers charts that are clear and concise and not overloaded with trivial information. The text of the book itself is a masterpiece in the art of delivering an immense amount of information in just a few paragraphs.\n\nThe reader will receive a great deal of information that will be extremely enlightening concerning the history of the Bible. The text and charts found within this volume will help the reader clearly understand the order and validity of the many English Bibles which have been printed over the centuries.\n-Samuel C. Gipp, Th.D, Ph.D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ce13c9998decf549cf5d5f019148f8845cbcf0","amp;dn":"Charted+History+of+the+Bible+-+James+C.+Kahler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ce13c9998decf549cf5d5f019148f8845cbcf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,206,19,201,153,141,236,245,73,207,93,95,1,145,72,248,132,92,188,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
