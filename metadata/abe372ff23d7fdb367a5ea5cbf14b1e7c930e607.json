Born into a wealthy family, he started learning to play various musical instruments at an early age. He was particularly interested in the mandolin. As an instrument player, he was a member of the world famous Smyrna Estudiantina &amp;#039;the Politakia&amp;#039; in the early 20th century, like another great composer of the Smyrna school, Spyros Peristeris.\n\nWhen the Greeks were uprooted from Asia Minor, he settled in Athens in 1924 and became the director of Odeon. Most of the 1923-1932 recordings were made under his supervision, when the creators and singers from Asia Minor were the main expressers of popular music. As the art director of Columbia (1931-1940), Tountas continued to dominate the recording business in Greece in a period when the Smyrna school was gradually giving way to Rebetiko (Greek urban folk song), which was mainly represented by Markos Vamvakaris.\n\nTountas Panagiotis died in 1942 from rheumatism.\n \n\n\n\n1.
