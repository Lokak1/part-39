When the facility unexpectedly closes they are forced to return to Concordia Medical Institute, where politics are more important than patients lives, and doctors more concerned with image than their ministration. They are recruited into the government organization Caduceus, where they will learn of a conspiracy with dire ramifications, and their lives will be changed forever.
