Solar technologies already provide energy for heat, light, hot water, electricity, and cooling for homes, businesses, and industry. Because solar energy only accounts for one-tenth of a percent of primary energy demand, relatively small increases in market penetration can lead to very rapid growth rates in the industryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢which is exactly what has been projected for coming years as the world moves away from carbon-based energy production. Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes, Third Edition provides the latest thinking and practices for engineering solar technologies and using them in various markets.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Basic theory, systems design, and applications\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Updated material on photovoltaics and wind power systems\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New homework problems and exercises\n\nBooknews\n\nMany of the newest developments in solar energy science and technology are covered in this updated and expanded reference-text (first edition, 1980). There is a thorough, up-to-date review of solar energy principles and the functioning, design and economics of solar thermal processes. Convection and radiation, properties of materials, components, systems and applications to active space and water heating are discussed. Includes examples and problems of tabulated radiation data and conversion factors. Annotation c.
