I'm Casey Kasem.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThis week marks the first time a brother and sister are in the top 40 with separate solo hits.\n\n&quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; by the Gogo's set a record for most weeks on the chart for a single by a female group. On this chart that record is broken by another female group.\n\nA pair of listeners both ask the same question; &quot;What's the largest group ever to hit the top 40?&quot; This 325 member vocal group hit the top 40 with a song that became popular during the American Civil War. \n\n&quot;Sea Of Love&quot; by The Honeydrippers has been a hit twice before and Casey plays portions of both earlier versions.\n\nThere's an English band that has averaged a hit every three months for the past two years.\n\nThere's a new song by the man who also wrote the most recorded pop song of all time. It's been recorded about two thousand times.\n\nFour top ten hits was all anybody could ever get until &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson generated seven top ten hits. The second album to break the &quot;four top ten&quot; barrier has a song in this countdown.\n\nI Feel For You (by Chaka Khan at number 4) was written and originally recorded by Prince. Casey plays some of his version.\n\n40:    Centipede - Rebbie Jackson\n39:    I Need You Tonight - Peter Wolf\n38:    Tears - John Waite        \n37:    I Do' Wanna Know - Reo Speedwagon     \n36:    Sugar Don't Bite - Sam Harris     \n35:    Who Wears These Shoes - Elton John    \n34:    We Are The Young - Dan Hartman\n33:    Girls With Guns - Tommy Shaw\n32:    Do What You Do - Jermaine Jackson\n31:    Hello Again - The Cars\n30:    Lucky Star - Madonna\n29:    Valotte - Julian Lennon    \n28:    Teacher Teacher - .38 Special\n27:    I Can't Drive 55 - Sammy Hagar\nLDD:   Through The Years - Kenny Rogers\n26:    Some Guys Have All The Luck - Rod Stewart\n25:    We Belong - Pat Benetar\n24:    I'm So Excited - Pointer Sisters\n23:    Walking On A Thin Line - Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n22:    It Ain't Enough - Corey Hart\n21:    On The Dark Side - John Cafferty &amp; The Beaver Brown Band\n20:    I Can't Hold Back - Survivor\n19:    The Wild Boys - Duran Duran\n18:    Sea Of Love - The Honeydrippers\n17:    The War Song - Culture Club\n16:    Cool It Now - New Edition\n15:    What About Me - Kenny Rogers With Kim Carnes &amp; James Ingram\n14:    No More Lonely Nights - Paul McCartney\n13:    Hard Habit To Break - Chicago\n12:    Desert Moon - Dennis DeYoung\n11:    Blue Jean - David Bowie\n10:    Penny Lover - Lionel Richie\n9:    All Through The Night - Cyndi Lauper\n8:    Strut - Sheena Easton\n7:    Better Be Good To Me - Tina Turner\nLDD:  Memories (The Way We Were) - Barbra Streisand\n6:    Out Of Touch - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n5:    I Just Called To Say I Love You - Stevie Wonder\n4:    I Feel For You - Chaka Khan\n3:    Caribbean Queen - Billy Ocean\n2:    Purple Rain - Prince\n1:    Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go - Wham\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3d63b4451b7c97c6cfb861bc54ed5c794f03ae2","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1984_11_November_17th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3d63b4451b7c97c6cfb861bc54ed5c794f03ae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,214,59,68,81,183,201,124,108,251,134,27,197,78,213,199,148,240,58,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
