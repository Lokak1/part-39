It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a56189a9a6bccf7c347bd9a5e1848f422cd0b33","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a56189a9a6bccf7c347bd9a5e1848f422cd0b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,86,24,154,154,107,204,247,195,71,189,154,94,24,72,244,34,205,11,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
