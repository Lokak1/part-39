It is capable of determining areas of\npixels to be modified, areas of pixels to be partly modified and areas of pixels to remain unmodified. The\npartly modification means the restoration of the non-distinct edges of objects. It is done by reinstating their partly transparent nature and also by\nsubtracting the background color so that only the object color is left in these partly transparent regions. This ensures that the cut-out object will\nblend or composite correctly with a different background. The cutting objects may be used for collage, scrap-book and greeting card creation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd9bb42def52c501cd6d99add8b92da48b5aac4d","amp;dn":"Background+Remover+1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd9bb42def52c501cd6d99add8b92da48b5aac4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,155,180,45,239,82,197,1,205,109,153,173,216,185,45,164,139,90,172,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
