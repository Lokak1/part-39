These were both in Season 2, episode 6. This is only one of six episodes that survived. Once I have enough seeders, I'll upload the others. \n\nThe dead body of grumpy Bill McCarthy is found, brained with a rock, and his son James, with whom he did not get on, is arrested. James' girl-friend approaches Holmes, who discovers that Bill's dying words were nothing to do with &quot;a rat&quot; but concerned with the days of the Australian Gold Rush, decades earlier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90c1b5ec543eeb9b9df94e501ea7d4c2f521271e","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+in+The+Boscombe+Valley+Mystery%2C+1968%2C+Peter+Cush","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90c1b5ec543eeb9b9df94e501ea7d4c2f521271e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,193,181,236,84,62,235,155,157,249,78,80,30,167,212,194,245,33,39,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
