You may not all agree with my approach on certain things, but my persistence and effort should never be questioned.  So I mean it with the utmost sincerity when I thank the following 14 people who recently contributed three song recommendations for my &quot;Various - 2013 - Piratebay Christian Music Mixtape, Vol 1&quot; ... studog123, JWaM, sicanddisturbed, kbb81tn, lategrad, blaheiei, Varkias, BlessedMom, PaleoPirate, novice13, peteyjc, van_pyf, Steve16drcsa, and Nathan.S.\n\nAlthough I am a little surprised that more people didn't participate, especially those of you whom I spend a great deal of my time routinely and quickly answer discography requests for, I am thankful for the efforts of the 14 Christians above.  And I must say that I had a chance to listen to the entire disc 2x through today, on an afternoon road trip I needed to take.  Good stuff.  So thanks again guys.  :)\n\nA genre breakdown for this bundle...\n\nALTERNATIVE: A Rotterdam November, Exodus Swift, George Michael Dile.
