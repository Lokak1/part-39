This is known as a backlog of shows as there isn't\nenough time for BARGE or the other groups to pre them at a\ncertain time.\n\nWe decided to go through every recording and only pre whole\nseries or single episodes that would complete a existing pred\nseries. If we did them all we would be preing until Xmas!\n\nWe could of just deleted all the recordings and forgot about\nit, but this would be a shame to all those series with\nmissing episodes within them.\n\nNone of them were Webrips and we only resort to Webrips if\ntheres absolutely no other alternative, to complete a\nvery popular series.\n\n\nWe are currently looking for legit 100mbit+ sites\nto affil.\n                          ________         __\n           _____         |__|__|__|__   __|__|\n        __|__|__|_____   |__|__|__|__| |__|__|\n   ____|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|_|__|__|__\n    \\_ THE TV BARGE                           _/\n      \\______________________________________/\n~~..  ...~~~.  ...~~~.  ..~  ....~~~...  ~~.  ..~ ~~..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63621991159ae547215ac087230087bdb4945812","amp;dn":"River.Cottage.Veg.S01E04.WS.PDTV.XviD-BARGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63621991159ae547215ac087230087bdb4945812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,98,25,145,21,154,229,71,33,90,192,135,35,0,135,189,180,148,88,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
