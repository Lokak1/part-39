Appropriately named the Deep Web, this mysterious and complex cyberspace serves as an outlet for anonymous communication and was home to Silk Road, the online black market notorious for drug trafficking. The intricacies of this concealed cyber realm caught the attention of the general public with the October 2013 arrest of Ross William Ulbricht - the convicted 30-year-old entrepreneur accused to be 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' the online pseudonym of the Silk Road leader. Making its World Television Premiere this spring, Deep Web - an EPIX Original Documentary written, directed and produced by Alex WinterÃ¢â‚¬â€¹ (DownloadedÃ¢â‚¬â€¹) - seeks to unravel this tangled web of Ã¢â‚¬â€¹secrecy, Ã¢â‚¬â€¹accusations,Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ andÃ¢â‚¬â€¹ criminal activity, and explores how the outcome of Ulbricht's trial will set a critical precedent for the future of technological freedom around the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9edb043e042e4033e4acbcb74fe950a9828691ca","amp;dn":"Deep_Web.%282015%29.WebRip.UBFlixRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9edb043e042e4033e4acbcb74fe950a9828691ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,219,4,62,4,46,64,51,228,172,188,183,79,233,80,169,130,134,145,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
