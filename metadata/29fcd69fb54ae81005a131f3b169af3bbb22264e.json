The Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji has decided to step aside to make room for the younger blood of his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo, the Lord's only wish now being to live out his years as an honored guest in the castle of each of his sons in turn. While the older two sons flatter their father, the youngest son attempts to warn him of the folly of expecting the three sons to remain united; enraged at the younger son's attempt to point out the danger, the father banishes him. True to the younger son's warning, however, the oldest Son soon conspires with the second son to strip The Great Lord of everything, even his title.\n\n\nVIDEO:\nFormat                           : AVI\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 201 Kbps\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nBit rate                         : 932 Kbps\nWidth                            : 512 pixels\nHeight                           : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nWriting library                  : DivX 5.0.5 (UTC 2003-04-24)\n\nAUDIO: \nID                            \nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 116 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29fcd69fb54ae81005a131f3b169af3bbb22264e","amp;dn":"Ran.%5BMasterworks.Edition%5D.%5BJap-Eng.Sub%5D.%5BDVDRip.DivX5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29fcd69fb54ae81005a131f3b169af3bbb22264e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,252,214,159,181,74,232,16,5,161,49,243,177,105,175,59,187,34,38,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
