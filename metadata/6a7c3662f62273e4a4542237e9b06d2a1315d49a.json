Their musical style is a distinctive blend of hip hop beats, laced with samples lifted from the rich seam of Polish jazz records of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nSkalpel returns with new tunes after a lengthy sabbatical.\n\nDuo, established by composers and producers well known in broadly defined electronic music circles. Their trademark was referencing a rich heritage of Polish jazz of the 1960s and the 1970s, with inspiration taken from the likes of Komeda, StaÃ…â€žko, Urbaniak and molding all of those retro ideas into their own original vision of contemporary sound. Two internationally acclaimed albums Ã¢â‚¬Å¾SkalpelÃ¢â‚¬Å“ and Ã¢â‚¬Å¾KonfusionÃ¢â‚¬Å“ released at that time by Ninja Tune put Skalpel on the radar of curious and avid fans of different genres of music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from jazz, through electronica to club and hip-hop.\n\nAfter a few years break Skalpel is back with brand new tracks to be released later in the year on Ã¢â‚¬Å¾TransitÃ¢â‚¬Å“ album but before it happens there is more music: they will start off with Ã¢â‚¬Å¾SimpleÃ¢â‚¬Å“ that will give a little sample of bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new sound and contains three extra tracks that will not feature on the album, a remix and an intro to Ã¢â‚¬Å¾TransitÃ¢â‚¬Å“ in the form of it the title track. This will be a treat for those who have patiently waited since 2005.\ncredits\n\nreleased 01 May 2014\n\nTracklist:\n1. Simple \t\n2. Salvadanio \t\n3. On The Road \t\n4. Simple \t\n5.
