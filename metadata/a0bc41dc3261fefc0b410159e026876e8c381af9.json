Public. These recordings' mix of jazz fusion, album-oriented rock, and Peacock's unusual blend of jazzy singing with sensually spoken intellectual poetic passages was too offbeat to get any more than a cult audience, though it's more accessible than many a cult rock artist's work. This is as complete a document of that part of her career as any fan could wish for, containing the entirety of her 1978 album, X-Dreams, and its 1979 follow-up, The Perfect Release, as well as two outtakes from The Perfect Release (&quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;What's It Like in Your Dreams&quot;) that first appeared on the 1982 compilation The Collection. The outtakes aren't mere window dressing, but are fairly interesting, Peacock singing in Spanish for &quot;Mexico,&quot; and &quot;What's It Like in Your Dreams&quot; being an effective sultry ballad.\n\nLabel: Sanctuary Records\nCatalog#: CMRCD 956\nFormat: CD, Compilation\nCountry: UK\nReleased: 2004\nGenre: Jazz, Rock\nStyle: Avantgarde, Experimental, Easy Listening\n\n1.
