This set contains all 27 symphonies, several overtures and other miscellaneous orchestral pieces.\n\nPerformed by the USSR State Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Svetlanov. These files come from a 16 CD box set.\n\n\n\nEncoded in FLAC compression-level 5.\n\n\n**Tagging is done as follows:\nArtist == Composer\nAlbum == Name of the work\nTitle == Title of a part or movement in a work\nGenre == The performer(s)\nTrack == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.\n\nI've done filenames as &quot;%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title&quot;\n\n\nIf there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bae2d49da4e14fe4e15d24a292f4412320649839","amp;dn":"Myaskovsky+-+Symphonies%2C+Orchestral+Works+%28Svetlanov%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bae2d49da4e14fe4e15d24a292f4412320649839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,226,212,157,164,225,79,228,225,93,36,162,146,244,65,35,32,100,152,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
