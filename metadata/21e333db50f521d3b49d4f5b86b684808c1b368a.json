At the end of the benchmark, just read the o3Marks score in the result dialog box. The o3Mark score is simple: it's the number of frames that have been displayed during the benchmark. Thus the higher the score, the more powerful the graphics system is.\n\nXtreme Burning is a mode where the workload of GPU is maximal. \nIn this mode, the donut is fixe and is displayed in front side which offers the largest surface. In this mode, the GPU quickly becomes very hot.\n\nThe Xtreme Burning mode can be started in command line or directly by launching the file start-Xtreme-Burning.bat. \nThis mode is perfect for testing your new overclocking parameters.\n\n\nFurMark is a freeware, please read the EULA.txt before use. \nIf you wish to contact the author, just send an email to jegx[AT]ozone3d[DOT]net and add [FURMARK] to the mail subject.\n\n\nOkay letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s see the main bugs the Catalyst 9.1 has brought to OpenGL users / developers:\n\nOpenGL\n\n* 1 - first of all, a nice crash in one of the most basic OpenGL function, glGetString(GL_VERSION), when an OpenGL 3.0 rendering context is enabled.\nWith an OpenGL 2.1 context, there is no problem.\n\n* 2 - second bug with Catalyst A.I. (A.I. for Artificial Intelligence) \n(or CCC A.I.):\n\no CCC A.I enabled (slider on Advanced): crash\no CCC A.I enabled (slider on Quality): OK\no CCC A.I disabled: OK\n\nThe crash (in the glTexImage2D function) with CCC A.I. came from texture pixel format. Some textures used by FurMark were in 3-channel RGB format and when CCC A.I. is set to Advanced, I think the driver expects a 4-channel RGBA texture to perform some clever (what?) anti-aliasing tricks. \nAnd if the application provides a 3-channel RGB texture, the driver crashes in glTexImage2D. So I simply bypassed Catalyst bug by setting to 4-channel RGBA all textures used by FurMark. Now, no matter if CCC A.I is enabled or disabled, FurMark works fine.\n\nSome Geeks3D readers have reported crashes with other OpenGL applications like Second Life. Disabling CCC A.I. fixes these crashes.\n\n\nFurMark 1.6.5 ChangeLog:\n\n* Change: Workaround for Catalyst 9.1 when Catalyst A.I is enabled: all textures used by FurMark are now in 4-channel RGBA format (in the previous versions, some textures were in 3-channel RGB formatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦).\n\n* Change: the OpenGL version used by the renderer is now displayed in stability test mode (near rendererÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s description) - thanks to David Legrand ;)\n\n* Change: by default the creation of an OpenGL 3.0 rendering context is disabled. If you want to enable it, just start FurMark in command line with the /gl3 parameter or use the batch file called Start-FurMark-OGL3.bat.\n\n* Change: small modifications in OpenGL 3.0 context creation.\n\n* Change: workaround for Catalyst 9.1 bug in glGetString(GL_VERSION) when an OpenGL 3.0 context is used.\n\n* Removed: timer check in contest mode.\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nIf you want to download ATI Catalyst 9.1, then you can check this two torrents that I have uploaded:\n\n\nATI CatalystÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Software Suite 9.1 XP (32-bit)\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4686984/ATI_Catalyst__Software_Suite_9.1_XP_(32-bit)\n\nATI CatalystÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Software Suite 9.1 Vista (32-bit)\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4689081/ATI_Catalyst__Software_Suite_9.1_Vista_(32-bit)\n\n\nHere are the link to the Furmark Homepage:\nhttp://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/#techdata","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e333db50f521d3b49d4f5b86b684808c1b368a","amp;dn":"FurMark+1.6.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e333db50f521d3b49d4f5b86b684808c1b368a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,227,51,219,80,245,33,211,180,157,79,91,134,182,132,128,140,27,54,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
