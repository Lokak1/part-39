Crowded raised beds require high inputs of water, fertility and organic matter, and demand large amounts of human time and effort. But, except for labor, these inputs depend on the price of oil. Prior to the 1970s, North American home food growing used more land with less labor, with wider plant spacing, with less or no irrigation, and all done with sharp hand tools. But these sustainable systems have been largely forgotten. Gardening When It Counts helps readers rediscover traditional low-input gardening methods to produce healthy food.\n\nDesigned for readers with no experience and applicable to most areas in the English-speaking world except the tropics and hot deserts, this book shows that any family with access to 3-5,000 sq. ft. of garden land can halve their food costs using a growing system requiring just the odd bucketful of household waste water, perhaps two hundred dollars worth of hand tools, and about the same amount spent on supplies - working an average of two hours a day during the growing season.\n\nSteve Solomon is a well-known west coast gardener and author of five previous books, including Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades which has appeared in five editions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae19893324f16741f2cbbb645a3efe6daf5c0b76","amp;dn":"Gardening+When+It+Counts%3A+Growing+Food+in+Hard+Times+%28Mother+Ear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae19893324f16741f2cbbb645a3efe6daf5c0b76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,25,137,51,36,241,103,65,242,203,187,100,90,62,254,109,175,92,11,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
