His teachings are based on \nthe unity of the soul and Brahman, in which Brahman is viewed as without attributes. \nHe hailed from Kalady of present day Kerala. Sankara travelled across India and other parts of South Asia to propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. He founded four mathas (monasteries), which helped in the historical development, revival and spread of Advaita Vedanta. Adi Sankara is believed to be the organizer of the Dasanami monastic order and the founder of the Shanmata tradition of worship.\n\nHis works in Sanskrit concern themselves with establishing the \ndoctrine of Advaita (Non-dualism). He also established the importance of monastic life \nas sanctioned in the Upanishads and Brahma Sutra, in a time \nwhen the Mimamsa school established strict ritualism and \nridiculed monasticism. Sankara represented his works as elaborating on ideas found \nin the Upanishads, and he wrote copious commentaries on \nthe Vedic Canon (Brahma Sutra, Principal Upanishads and Bhagavadgita) in support of \nhis thesis. The main opponent in his work is the Mimamsa school of thought, \nthough he also offers some arguments against the views of some other schools like \nSamkhya and certain schools of Buddhism that he was partly familiar with.\n\nDESCRIPTION ABOUT THE TORRENT:\n\nThe Works of Sri Sankaracharya [Memorial Edition], 20 volumes published in 1910 by \nSri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam, remains to this day the standard collection of \nthe complete works of Sri Sankaracharya. \nIt includes Sri Sankaracharya's major commentaries as well as his other works, \nas given in the list below. \n\n1. Brahmasutra-bhashya \n2. Brahmasutra-bhashya \n3. Brahmasutra-bhashya \n4. Upanishad-bhashya, vol. 1: Isa, Kena [2], Katha, Prasna \n5. Upanishad-bhashya, vol. 2: Mundaka, Mandukya, Aitareya \n6. Upanishad-bhashya, vol. 3: Taittiriya, Chhandogya 1-3 \n7. Upanishad-bhashya, vol. 4: Chhandogya 4-8 \n8. Upanishad-bhashya, vol. 5: Brihadaranyaka 1-2 \n9. Upanishad-bhashya, vol. 6: Brihadaranyaka 3-4 \n10.Upanishad-bhashya, vol. 7: Brihadaranyaka 5-6, Nrisimhapurvatapani \n11.Bhagavad-Gita-bhashya, vol. 1: chaps. 1-9 \n12.Bhagavad-Gita-bhashya, vol. 2: chaps. 10-18 \n13.Vishnusahasranama and Sanatsujatiya Bhashyas \n14.Vivekachudamani, Upadeshasahasri \n15.Miscellaneous Prakaranas vol. 1: Aparokshanubhuti, etc. [7 works] \n16.Miscellaneous Prakaranas vol. 2: Prabodhasudhakara, etc. [25 works] \n17.Stotras, vol. 1 [30 works] \n18.Stotras, vol. 2 [35 works, plus Lalita Trisatistotra Bhashya] \n19.Prapanchasara, vol. 1 \n20.Prapanchasara, vol. 2 \n\nThere are thus a total of 118 works, counting the two Kena Upanishad bhashyas separately, in this collection. Both Indian and Western scholars agree that many of these works must have been written by later Sankaracharyas rather than the original or \nAdi Sankaracharya. But there is no agreement on which ones are genuinely his. Moreover, there are many other texts attributed to Sankaracharya that are not found in this collection, some of which may have been written by Adi Sankaracharya. So it is not a definitive collection of his writings. Nor does it lay any claim to being a critical edition. Its readings can often be improved by comparison with other printed editions and manuscripts. It is \nsimply the standard collection we have at present.\n\nJust extract the Pdf files from RAR files to enjoy reading books..\n\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..PLZ KEEP ALIVE HIS WORKS AND SAVE OUR PRIDE..\n\nIT IS VERY SAD THAT THE RELIGIOUS BOOKS HAVE NO GREAT SEEDS TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.\n\nONLY FEW STOOD UP TO SEED THESE GREAT TORRENTS..\n\nPLZ SEEEDD..DO IT FOR HINDUISM.
