International pressure has been mounting on Iran since the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency revealed in a report the &quot;possible military dimensions&quot; to Iran's nuclear activities, citing &quot;credible&quot; evidence that &quot;indicates that Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.&quot; In his latest article for The New Yorker blog, titled &quot;Iran and the IAEA,&quot; Hersh argues the recent report is a &quot;political document,&quot; not a scientific study. &quot;They [JSOC] found nothing. Nothing. No evidence of any weaponization,&quot; Hersh says. &quot;In other words, no evidence of a facility to build the bomb. They have facilities to enrich, but not separate facilities to build a bomb. This is simply a fact.&quot;\n\n\n- Tahrir Square Under Attack: 32 Egyptians Killed, 1,750 Injured in Protests Against Military Rule\n\nMass protests across Egypt have entered a third day, calling on the country's military rulers to quickly transfer power to a civilian government. The fiercest clashes are taking place in Cairo's Tahrir Square where thousands of protesters have battled with security forces since Saturday morning. The Associated Press reports today Egypt's Ministry of Health has raised its casualty figures to 35 dead and more than 1,750 wounded. &quot;Our demands at the beginning of the revolution were freedom, dignity and social justice. We have not seen social justice,&quot; says Nasser Abdul Hadi, one of the protesters interviewed in a video report by Democracy Now! correspondent Sharif Abdel Kouddous, who is ground in Cairo and has covered the protests since they began.

The two officers involved in the incident were placed on administrative leave, and the incident has sparked calls for the resignation of UC-Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi, who initially defended the actions of the campus police. Katehi has since said she wants an outside, independent panel to review what happened. We speak with Elli Pearson, one of the students pepper sprayed on Friday. &quot;All I could see was people telling me to cover my head, protect myself, and put my head down. And the next thing I know, I was pepper sprayed,&quot; says Pearson, who notes she was protesting in solidarity with students at UC-Berkeley who were beaten by police, and against tuition hikes at universities across the country. We also talk to Nathan Brown, assistant professor of English at UC-Davis, who wrote an open letter calling for the resignation of Chancellor Katehi following the pepper-spraying incident Friday. &quot;In my opinion, the best way to go about these things as a junior faculty member is to speak up openly,&quot; says Brown, who is not tenured. &quot;In that way, you draw a lot of support, and I think that will be very helpful in protecting me and other people who speak out, if there is any effort of retribution by the administration.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06fa9d9a3fbf7353e73934d746b489bb692cf777","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+21+nov+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06fa9d9a3fbf7353e73934d746b489bb692cf777","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,250,157,154,63,191,115,83,231,57,52,215,70,180,137,187,105,44,247,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
