He crammed more adventure into his thirty-three years than any other human being before or since, and now for the first time a novelist will tell the tale in a single suitably epic volume. The combination of Alexander's life story and Christian Cameron's unrivalled skills as an historian and storyteller will ensure that this will not only be the definitive version for many years to come, but also one of the most exciting historical epics ever written.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e4df844ba1952f454107534994f48ca8a4b374e","amp;dn":"God+of+War%3A+Alexander+the+Great++%282012+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e4df844ba1952f454107534994f48ca8a4b374e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,77,248,68,186,25,82,244,84,16,117,52,153,79,72,202,138,75,55,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
