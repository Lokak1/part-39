This is from a rather hard to find Globestyle Records release entitled Zambiance, featuring the music of Zambia. African guitar is amazing in its own right and this CD is a good example - not theory or tech heavy, just plain nice sounding and rhythmic guitar.''\n\nZambia: Zambia is a large, landlocked country in central Africa with a population of 7 million people from over 73 tribes. Originally the British colony of Northern Rhodesia, Zambia obtained Independence on 24 October 1964. It is three quarters the size of western Europe. Although English has been adopted as an official language, most recordings are made in the vernacular languages. The music scene have been influenced heavily (as in much of Africa) by Zairean rumba &amp; soukous giving rise to a Zambian style known as 'Zam-Rhumba', although pioneering work in the 60s and 70s by Alick Nkhata and Nashil Pichen Kazembe concentrated on the Zambian background to the music, and before them acoustic guitarist George Sibanda had a wide impact in central and east Africa. The most popular current styles apart from Zam-Rhumba' are Kalindula  -  a modernised roots music, and Mantyantya - a mid-tempo style, traditional in essence, from the North-Western part of the country and only sung in Kaonde  -  featured by groups such as Shalawambe and Massau Band ~liner notes\n\n01.
