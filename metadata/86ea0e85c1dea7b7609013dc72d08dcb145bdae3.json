She offers a clearer and more detailed picture of the beginnings of the cult of relics, which were an essential asset to the Church in its establishment of pilgrimage centres and local hagiographic heritage sites, first in Italy and later in other places around Europe and North Africa. At the same time, Noga-Banai highlights the identity of the objects as portable art, treating the reliquaries as visual historical testimonies. The book is illustrated with nearly 100 finely reproduced drawings and photographs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86ea0e85c1dea7b7609013dc72d08dcb145bdae3","amp;dn":"The+Trophies+of+the+Martyrs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86ea0e85c1dea7b7609013dc72d08dcb145bdae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,234,14,133,193,222,167,183,96,144,19,220,114,208,141,203,20,91,218,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
