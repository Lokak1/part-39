The title is taken from the first words of the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter, which some authorities believe was an authentic message sent from the killer in 1888. The collected edition is 572 pages long. The 2000 and later editions are the most common prints. The comic was loosely adapted into a film of the same title, released in 2001.\n\n\ncbr format read in cddisplay or comicrack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c3eded1680d7bfc948f4f6d80349a806ea7308","amp;dn":"From+Hell+%28TPB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c3eded1680d7bfc948f4f6d80349a806ea7308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,195,237,237,22,128,215,191,201,72,244,246,216,3,73,168,6,234,115,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
