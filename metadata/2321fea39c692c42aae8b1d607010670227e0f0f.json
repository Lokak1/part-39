This CD also featured an extra track at 7:06 (666) on the last song of the CD. This is also featured in this digital version. \nThere were only 100 of these CD's ever pressed! It's amazing to see that 10 years later, this album has become an underground cult classic in so many different countries in the form of internet file sharing, and fan made YouTube videos. This band was a great time in our lives, and we appreciate all of you fiends out there who are keeping it alive!\ncredits\nreleased 31 October 2004 \n\nJeff Hearse She-Vocals \nPaul Bearer-Bass \nMigal Maul-Guitar \nClodes-Drums \n\nRecorded August 2004 by Roger Camero at Where Pigs Fly Studios in Ventura, CA \nMastered by Paul Miner\n\n\n\nzombiRG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2321fea39c692c42aae8b1d607010670227e0f0f","amp;dn":"Hybrid+Moments-The+Haunted+%7Bhorrorpunk%7D+horrorhound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2321fea39c692c42aae8b1d607010670227e0f0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,33,254,163,156,105,44,66,170,232,177,214,7,1,6,112,34,126,15,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
