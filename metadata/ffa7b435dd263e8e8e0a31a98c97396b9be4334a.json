While to her parents and teachers getting Adam Ant tickets is no big deal, to Bleu L. Finnegan it means everything. This could be the defining moment of her life, and there is no guarantee that she will ever achieve it. On the way, Bleu must deal with the travails of adolescence - from prank-playing, porn-addicted boys to sexist-pig radio disc jockeys to trying to figure out how to show that dreamy substitute teacher that she's his perfect mate.\n\nIncludes the following collections from Oni Press:\n\nBlue Monday Vol. 1: The Kids Are Alright \nBlue Monday Vol. 2: Absolute Beginners\nBlue Monday Vol. 3: Inbetween Days\nBlue Monday Vol. 4: Painted Moon\n\nI did not scan these, so thanks go out to the original scanners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa7b435dd263e8e8e0a31a98c97396b9be4334a","amp;dn":"Blue+Monday+%282000-2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa7b435dd263e8e8e0a31a98c97396b9be4334a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,167,180,53,221,38,62,142,142,10,49,169,140,151,57,107,155,228,51,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
