But at what cost?\n\nFrom the age of ten, when she made her acting debut on Good Times, Janet was told by Hollywood that she needed to slim down. Her well-meaning brothers, especially fun-loving Michael, teased her relentlessly until she began to believe that who she was wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t good enough. It was an idea that no amount of critical acclaim in television and film or, later, international platinum success in music could change.\n\nJanet turned to food for comfort and escape. She developed a self-destructive pattern familiar to so many of us: fear and uncertainty led to bad feelings about herself and ultimately depression. The depression led to overeating. And her yo-yoing weight was painfully obvious in the bright lights of the entertainment world.\n\nIt has taken Janet most of her adult life to come to terms with who she is. But she has finally broken free of the attitudes that brought her down and has embraced realistic goals that help her eat better, exercise better, feel better, and ultimately be better.\n\nThis book is about meeting those challenges that face all of us. With candor and courage, Janet shares her painful journey to loving herself. She addresses the crazy rumors that have swirled around her for most of her life, shines an intimate light on her family, and pulls us behind the velvet rope into her unforgettable career. She also shares lessons she has learned through contact with friends and fans and reveals the fitness secrets she has learned from her trainer. Finally, her nutritionist, David Allen, unveils the wholesome, delicious recipes and lifestyle-changing tips that helped Janet get in shapeÃ¢â‚¬â€mind and spirit, heart and soul.\n\nTrue You is a call to tune in to your own fundamental wisdom, to let go of the ugly comparisons, and to understand that who you are, the true you, is more than enough.\n\n***\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m loved, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m valued, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m capable of achieving balance in my life. I can learn to eat well. I can exercise. I can express gratitude for the simple act of being able to breathe in and breathe out. I can move away from darkness and depression to light and hope. I can be happy with who I am, not what I should be, or what I might have been, or what someone tells me I must be.\n\nI am me, the true me; you are you, the true youÃ¢â‚¬â€and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ JANET JACKSON","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5c45b3dbd29147a3fcd5d491db83e4989a5369","amp;dn":"True+You+-+Janet+Jackson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5c45b3dbd29147a3fcd5d491db83e4989a5369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,92,69,179,219,210,145,71,163,252,213,212,145,219,131,228,152,154,83,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
