Drag a window until the cursor enters one of these zones then drop the window to have it cinch into place. Cinching to the left or right edges of the screen will resize the window to fill exactly half the screen, allowing you to easily compare two windows side-by-side (splitscreen). Cinching to the top edge of the screen will resize the window to fill the entire screen (fullscreen). Dragging a window away from its cinched position will restore the window to its original size.\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.1\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Updated icons\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Compatibility update for future OS X release\n\nRequirements: OS X 10.6.5 or later\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5da000979bcaad1f1d783cddb570dd401d6afe58","amp;dn":"Cinch+1.1+%28Mac+App+Store%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5da000979bcaad1f1d783cddb570dd401d6afe58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,160,0,151,155,202,173,31,29,120,60,221,181,112,221,64,29,106,254,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
