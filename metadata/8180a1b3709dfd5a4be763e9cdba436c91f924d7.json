The knob controls the amount of saturation, and you can switch between three different distortion characteristics. With the switch set to Neutral, the entire frequency spectrum of the sound gets distorted when you turn up the Saturation knob. Put it on Keep High, and the saturation will mainly affect the lower part of the frequency spectrum, while the top end stays clear. With Keep Low selected, the low end will retain its clear sound, and only the high-frequency components of the sound will get distorted.\n\n\nFOR WIN/MAC\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n\nOnly works under R2R patched StudiOne release.\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Thats it!
