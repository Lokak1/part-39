Bass-led, with more of a classic glam stomp, the lyrics speak of not knowing where you are or where you're heading, Kory sympathising with the words given the many projects that he finds himself involved in.\n\n\n'Devil's Highway' pulls Kory back to a more expected political stance with lyrics dedicated to our seemingly never-ending struggle against the might of the military industrial complex. At chorus time it's as near as the album gets to prime Warrior Soul - think 'Last Decade Dead Century' - but the song's core is one made up of loops and samples, more Nine Inch Nails than Four More Years.\n\n\nIf you like the songs, buy the album when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s released later this year.\n\n\nCheck out the most recent Warrior Soul album here:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8380524/Warrior_Soul_-_Stiff_Middle_Finger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8380524/Warrior_Soul_-_Stiff_Middle_Finger&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed.\n\n\nCheers\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cae24a76656c664ae2f4de11677bfc08480d6a01","amp;dn":"Kory+Clarke+-+Payback%27s+A+Bitch+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cae24a76656c664ae2f4de11677bfc08480d6a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,226,74,118,101,108,102,74,226,244,222,17,103,123,252,8,72,13,106,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
