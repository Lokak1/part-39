Ward explores what really happens when good and evil toy with humanity in her new novel of the Fallen Angels, as the salvation of a doomed soul depends once again on a crossroads....\n\nWhen Cait Douglass resolves to get over her broken heart, throw off her inhibitions, and start really living, she's unprepared for the two sensual men who cross her path. Torn between them, she doesn't know which to choose - or what kind of dire consequences could follow.\n\nJim Heron, fallen angel and reluctant savior, is ahead in the war, but he puts everything at risk when he seeks to make a deal with the devil - literally. As yet another soul is unwittingly caught in the battle between him and the demon Devina, his fixation on an innocent trapped in Hell threatens to sidetrack him from his sacred duty....\n\nCan good still prevail if true love makes a savior weak? And will a woman's future be the key, or the curse, for all of humanity? Only time, and hearts, will tell.
