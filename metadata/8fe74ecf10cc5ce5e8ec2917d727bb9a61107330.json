But of the 18,000 sailors fighting for King and Country, 1,400 were not British, with 25 different nationalities in all press-ganged into serving the British King. By analysing the records of warship HMS Bellerophon, this fresh and action-packed account of the famous day reveals their fascinating story.\n\nDocumentary evidence proves the Navy recruited hundreds of black sailors, many of them ex-slaves from the West Indies and America. For many, the Royal Navy was the world's first equal opportunities employer, offering freedom, equal pay, and the chance for life-changing promotion.\n\nThis film pays tribute to the diverse nationalities that sailed on 21 October 1805, united not by patriotism, but by a unique opportunity for performance-related pay. The Admiralty promised every man at Trafalgar - irrespective of race, creed or colour - a fair share of any captured enemy ships. If they defeated the entire Combined Fleet, even the humblest sailor might become the equivalent of a millionaire.\n\nBetween these brave foreigners and a potential fortune, stood the bloodiest battle in naval history, a great storm and the mortal danger of fire, drowning or shipwreck.\n\nCh4 Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-untold-battle-of-trafalgar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-untold-battle-of-trafalgar&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nSource: HDTV\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 48mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.39 GB\nSubtitles: merged\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe74ecf10cc5ce5e8ec2917d727bb9a61107330","amp;dn":"Ch4+The+Untold+Battle+of+Trafalgar+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe74ecf10cc5ce5e8ec2917d727bb9a61107330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,231,78,207,16,204,92,229,232,236,41,23,215,39,187,154,97,16,115,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
