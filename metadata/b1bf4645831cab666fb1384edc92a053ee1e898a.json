One year later the Skynet system is activated, perceives humans as a threat to its own existence, and eradicates much of humanity in the event known as &quot;Judgment Day&quot; (as depicted in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines).In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads a Resistance attack on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but he is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. However, Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles.John returns to Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), the current leader, of his discovery. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency believed to be capable of sending an order to shut down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted &quot;kill list&quot; indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance's command staff in a week's time. John learns that his own name is second on the list, following a civilian named Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows that it is because Kyle will later become his father (as depicted in The Terminator). John meets with his wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and his subordinate Barnes (Common), and transmits a radio broadcast to Resistance members and surviving civilians around the world.\n\nGenre: Action | Drama | Sci-Fi\n\nRelease date: 3 June 2009 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nChristian Bale\nSam Worthington\nAnton Yelchin\nMoon Bloodgood\nBryce Dallas Howard\nCommon\nJadagrace Berry\nMichael Ironside\nHelena Bonham Carter\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:Terminator Salvation DC 720p BRRip\nFormat:Matroska\nFile size:1992.91 MiB\nDuration:1h 57mn\nOverall bit rate:2 368 Kbps\nSubtitles:Dutch\nEncoded Date:UTC 2011-05-22 12:27:47\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer:AVC\nVideo Codec Type:x264 - core 114 r1924 08d04a4\nAverage video bitrate:[/color]\nFrame Rate:[color=blue]23.976 fps\nEncoding type:2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio:2.35:1\nResolution:1280x544\nSource:Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language:English\nAudio Codec:AAC\nBitrate:%Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count:6 channels\nSample Rate:48.0 KHz\n\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/36057370411363486326.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/36057370411363486326.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61199890734462674493.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61199890734462674493.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/18755493267268467673.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/18755493267268467673.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/30788059396451704659.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/30788059396451704659.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/80347089645364601887.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/80347089645364601887.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/36057370411363486326.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/36057370411363486326.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/45823147195891981698.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/45823147195891981698.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1bf4645831cab666fb1384edc92a053ee1e898a","amp;dn":"Terminator+Salvation+DC+720p+BRRip+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene+Releas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1bf4645831cab666fb1384edc92a053ee1e898a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,191,70,69,131,28,171,102,111,177,56,78,220,146,160,83,238,30,137,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
