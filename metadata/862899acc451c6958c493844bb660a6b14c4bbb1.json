No commercials. With original music.\n\nFish Story\n\nIn an episode hated by creator Hugh Wilson, but loved by the fans, we see a day in the life of WKRP. Johnny and Venus are participating in a &quot;Drinking and Response Time&quot; on-air promotion. Mr. Carlson &amp; Andy are being interviewed for a newspaper about the changes at the station. The lobby is being painted by a lazy and slow painter. And Herb, dressed like a Karp (WKRP) gets into a fight with a guy dressed like a Pig (WPIG) in a college bathroom and gets arrested with Bailey and Les.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862899acc451c6958c493844bb660a6b14c4bbb1","amp;dn":"WKRP+S01E21+Fiory+%28as+originally+aired%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862899acc451c6958c493844bb660a6b14c4bbb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,40,153,172,196,81,198,149,140,73,56,68,187,102,10,107,20,196,187,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
