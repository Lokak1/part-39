Although widely associated with rock music, the band's sound incorporates progressive rock and pop rock elements.[citation needed] Since its formation, Prism has released 10 studio albums and three compilations.\n\nPrism achieved moderate international success in the early 1980s. In their homeland, the band achieved one number-one album on the Canadian Albums Chart and one number-one single on the Rock Tracks (March 27, 1982) chart.\n\n\n\nHistory \n\nThe original lineup consisted of session musicians brought together by Bruce Allen and Bruce Fairbairn. Drummer Jim Vallance and Bruce Fairbairn had a jazz rock band named Sunshyne. With the addition of Lindsay Mitchell and Ron Tabak, the band evolved into &quot;Under Construction&quot; ( also briefly &quot;Stanley Screamer&quot; ). The group finally changed its name to Prism when keyboardist John Hall joined. After signing with GRT Records, they released their debut album with a lineup of Ron Tabak, Lindsay Mitchell, Tom Lavin, John Hall, Ab Bryant and Jim Vallance, who both produced, and played drums under the name of &quot;Rodney Higgs.&quot; Vallance did not want to tour though, so left and was replaced by Rocket Norton. Vallance did, however, contribute drum tracks to the band's second album, See Forever Eyes.\n\nIn 1977, they released their self-titled album Prism ( which contained the hits &quot;Spaceship Superstar&quot; and &quot;Take Me to the Kaptin&quot; ) after which Bryant left (he would later join Chilliwack), and Al Harlow was brought in as a new guitarist and bassist. The band subsequently issued See Forever Eyes ( 1978 ).\n\nArmageddon was released in 1979, featuring some compositional input from the then largely unknown Bryan Adams, and Young and Restless was released in 1980.\n\nAfter the greatest hits album All the Best From Prism, Prism signed on with Capitol Records, at which point Tabak was fired due to &quot;lifestyle&quot; issues, and vocalist Henry Small was brought in. They then released Small Change (1981). The lead single &quot;Don't Let Him Know&quot; became their first top 40 hit in America and a number-one single on Billboard's then-new Rock Tracks chart, and the follow-up &quot;Turn on Your Radar&quot; also charted, becoming their fifth and final American hit. After Small Change, Mitchell, Harlow and Norton left Prism.\n\nIn 1982, the band's touring line up was Small, guitarist Paul Warren, bassist John Trivers, keyboardist Robyn Robbins, and Doug Maddick on drums.\n\nAlthough the band technically &quot;broke up&quot; in 1982, Small assembled a new &quot;group&quot; featuring Bill Champlin, Richie Zito, Mike Baird (renowned session drummer who later toured with Journey), and backup vocalists Bobby Kimball (Toto) and Alan Pasqua. Together, this line-up released the album Beat Street under the Prism name in 1983.\n\n\n\nDeath of Ron Tabak\n\nPlans for a Prism reunion with Tabak were cancelled when he died on 25 December 1984, one day after a brain hemorrhage he suffered from a cycling accident. According to one account, Tabak had been planning to spend Christmas with his Prism bandmate Harlow. On Christmas Eve at about 8 p.m., while riding his bicycle over to Harlow's residence, Tabak was struck by a passing vehicle and taken by ambulance to a local hospital. After an initial screening, however, physicians could not detect anything wrong with him, determining he was fit to be released. Tabak subsequently and abruptly became very combative, prompting the police to arrest him. While in his cell at the station, he became unconscious, upon which he was returned to the hospital. During this visit, a blood clot was discovered in his right cerebral hemisphere. Tabak never regained consciousness, and a pending neurosurgical operation never commenced.\n\n\n\nReunion and later years\n\nIn 1988, they reformed for another greatest hits album called Over 60 Minutes with...Prism, and five years later another new album, Jericho (1993), with Darcy Deutsch as vocalist, Harlow, Mitchell, Norton, and keyboardist Andy Lorimer. Studio musicians included Bryan Adams, Paul Janz, Mark LaFrance, with Rick Springfield doing some of the songwriting.\n\nThe band continues to tour with Harlow playing lead guitar and performing lead vocals and current line-up: Gary Grace (drums), Steve-O (Guitars &amp; Keys), Tad Goddard (Bass). 2007 saw the band in the studio working on a new album called Big Black Sky which was released in July 2008. The band's CDs (including Big Black Sky) are available for purchase from their official website.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 60 Minutes withÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n\n\n\n\nThis is a Greatest Hits Compilation released in 1988\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nGood To Be Back\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Him Know\nCover Girl\nYoung and Restless\nAmerican Music\nArmageddon\nVirginia\nYou Walked Away Again\nMirror Man\nNight to Remember \nSee Forever Eyes\nFlying\nTake Me Away\nIts Over\nOpen Soul Surgery\nTake me to the Captain\nSpaceship Superstar\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c80d460c541ef47e03901198e1389bc9887afa9","amp;dn":"Prism+-+Over+60+Minutes+With+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c80d460c541ef47e03901198e1389bc9887afa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,128,212,96,197,65,239,71,224,57,1,25,142,19,137,188,152,135,175,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
