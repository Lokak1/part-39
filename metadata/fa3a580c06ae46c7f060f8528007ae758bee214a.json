But as a ghost\n           he can not be seen or heard by the living, and so he tries to communicate with Molly\n           through Oda Mae Brown, a psychic who didn't even realise that her powers were real.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n                           Greets:\n                Much respects to these groups:\n   MAJESTiC, BabyGirl21, Friends, and other P2P Groups\n\n\n\n\n                            Notes:\n             &quot;You will always enjoy HQ SD x264 rips from\n                most Retail R1 DVD's&quot; - NoRBiT ;)\n\n\n\n                                               NFO Updated: 07-09-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa3a580c06ae46c7f060f8528007ae758bee214a","amp;dn":"Ghost.1990.Incl.Directors.Commentary.DVDRip.x264-NoRBiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa3a580c06ae46c7f060f8528007ae758bee214a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,58,88,12,6,174,70,199,240,96,248,82,128,7,174,117,139,238,33,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
