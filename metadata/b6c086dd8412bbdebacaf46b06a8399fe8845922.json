Zaikov et al. (AAP, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781466578050\r\n\r\nThrough a balanced combination of theory and experiments, this book provides a detailed overview of the main and most up-to-date advances in the area of polymeric materials. Because the subject is essentially interdisciplinary and brings together scientists and engineers with different educational backgrounds, the book offers a research-oriented exposition of the fundamentals as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book is based on the editorsâ€™ and authorsâ€™ extensive experience in research, development, and education in the field of materials science, and especially polymer testing, polymer diagnostics, and failure analysis. A comprehensive coverage of the methods of polymer testing is provided along with the results of the authorsâ€™ work on deformation and fracture behavior of polymers.\r\n\r\nThis book will be useful to faculty as well as advanced-level students in materials science, materials technology, plastic technology, mechanical engineering, process engineering, and chemical engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c086dd8412bbdebacaf46b06a8399fe8845922","amp;dn":"Multicomponent+Polymeric+Materials+-+From+Introduction+to+Applic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c086dd8412bbdebacaf46b06a8399fe8845922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,192,134,221,132,18,187,222,186,202,244,107,6,168,57,159,232,132,89,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
