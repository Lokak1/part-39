MoRE CoMING SooN. ENJoY!\n\n\n\n\nBurundi Musiques Traditionnelles\n\nPart of Ocora's extensive traditional music lines, \nthis album of music from Burundi attempts to present \nsome of the salient examples of musical traditions in \nthe old Kingdom. Some of the music is really quite amazing \nin the way that it can be both incredibly simple, but at \nthe same time almost mesmerizing. The works on the album \nare really more of the form for an ethnomusicologist, in \nthat many are simply a minute or two and exist solely to \ndemonstrate a given technique or instrument, but for those \nethnomusicologists, it will be quite worthwhile. There are \ndemonstrations of native inanga zithers, ubuhuha vocal techniques, \ndrum troupes, whispered singing techniques, musical bows, \nand ritualized greetings. Most aspects of the musical culture \nare represented in some fashion in the course of the album. For \nthose with the patience to endure it, this album is very noteworthy, \nat least in its musicological values, if not for its aesthetics. \n~ Adam Greenberg, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f27ce4d01d416497f5d66e9c345ce38d5d5ac54","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Burundi+Musiques+Traditionnelles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f27ce4d01d416497f5d66e9c345ce38d5d5ac54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,39,206,77,1,212,22,73,127,93,102,233,195,69,206,56,213,213,172,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
