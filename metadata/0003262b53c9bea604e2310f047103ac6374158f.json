Now, a year later, all three are together again in New York City where Livia is attending a conference on Native American art. But when Spencer is attacked in Central Park by a wolf, the trio are thrown deep into a world where money, Native American lore, and the doctrines of the Catholic Church collide, revealing an alarming secret: the wolf is a Shapeshifter. He is searching for a sacred Iroquois mask with power that, badly wielded, could destroy millions of lives. But as they enter the search for the mask, the three narrowly escape becoming the ShapeshifterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prey. Will they be able to prevent catastrophe from rising with the next full moon?\n\nIn Skin of the Wolf, Sam Cabot weaves riveting suspense into a world that blends historical fact with his signature all-encompassing alternate reality. It is a heart-stopping novel in which the Noantri discover they aren't the only humans set apart by their natures: there are Others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0003262b53c9bea604e2310f047103ac6374158f","amp;dn":"Sam+Cabot+-+Skin+of+the+Wolf+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0003262b53c9bea604e2310f047103ac6374158f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,3,38,43,83,201,190,166,4,226,49,15,4,113,3,172,99,116,21,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
