Although it sold respectably, it didn't have any major hit singles. Smyth returned to the top of the charts in 1992 with &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,&quot; a duet with Don Henley; the single hit number two and went gold. Its parent album, Patty Smyth, also went gold and featured two other minor hits, &quot;No Mistakes&quot; and &quot;I Should Be Laughing.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0pfixqt5ldte~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0pfixqt5ldte~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAMG Album Review:\n\nFor many years, Patty Smyth inexplicably lacked a hits compilation, but Columbia/Legacy finally issued the single-disc Greatest Hits in the fall of 1998. Drawing from both her solo recordings and her time with Scandal, from her recordings for both Columbia and MCA, the 16-track contains all of her hits, including &quot;Goodbye to You,&quot; &quot;The Warrior,&quot; Hands Tied,&quot; &quot;Beat of a Heart,&quot; and &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,&quot; her duet with Don Henley. The enticements for hardcore fans -- two new Matt Serletic-produced recordings (&quot;Wish I Were You,&quot; which is also on the Armageddon soundtrack, and &quot;Carnival Lights&quot;), plus an unreleased cut from Never Enough -- aren't particularly noteworthy, but for most fans, both casual and serious, it's a blessing to have all of the hits in one place, even if it's frustrating that the disc isn't sequenced in chronological order.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. The Warrior\n02. Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough\n03. Wish I Were You\n04. Carnival Lights\n05. Love's Got A Line On You\n06. Goodbye To You\n07. I Should Be Laughing\n08. Downtown Train\n09.
