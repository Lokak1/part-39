In addition, Democracy Now! hosts real debatesâ€“debates between people who substantially disagree, such as between the White House or the Pentagon spokespeople on the one hand, and grassroots activists on the other.\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now!\r\nWednesday, June 29, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport independent news! \nhttp://www.democracynow.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f1df03e8177ed33adf1a386e32917d563668d0","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now%21+2016-06-29+-+Istanbul+Terror+%2B+SCOTUS+%2B+Jara+Case","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f1df03e8177ed33adf1a386e32917d563668d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,241,223,3,232,23,126,211,58,223,26,56,110,50,145,125,86,54,104,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
