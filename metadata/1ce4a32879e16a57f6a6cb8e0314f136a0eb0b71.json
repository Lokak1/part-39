You may be right. But before you make another move, consider this: your brain is hardwired with a unique combination of 12 different Executive Skills -the cognitive strengths that determine how well you will perform in a particular role. Your strongest and weakest Executive Skills can make the difference between big-time career success and years of disappointment and failure. &quot;Work Your Strengths&quot; helps you avoid 'trial-and-error' career moves by matching your strengths to the jobs that call on those skills specifically. Based on the authors' two-year study of more than 2000 top-performers at hundreds of organizations of all types, from Fortune 500 companies to nonprofits, the book reveals which strengths correlate with success in different jobs. Take a one-time, free online profile to determine your unique strengths and weaknesses and then use that information to identify your ideal career path. Not ready for a move yet? &quot;Work Your Strengths&quot; can also make a world of difference in the job you're in now. It can help you not only focus on the projects best suited for you but also recognize skills in others and assign tasks accordingly.
