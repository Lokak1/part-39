The prospector and the preacher were witnesses at the singularly memorable rape and murder trial of the notorious Mexican outlaw Carasco. The bandit duped an aristocratic Southerner into believing he knew the location of a lost Aztec treasure. The greedy &quot;gentleman&quot; allows himself to be tied up while Carasco deflowers his wife. These events lead to the stabbing of the husband and are related by the three eyewitnesses to the atrocity: the infamous bandit, the newlywed wife, and the dead man through an Indian shaman. Whose version of the events is true? Possibly there was a fourth witness, but can his version be trusted?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55544fc3768fceeb98c1f754a3ece7ec39bf0b34","amp;dn":"The+Outrage++%28Western+Drama+1964%29++Paul+Newman%2C+Laurence+Harvey+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55544fc3768fceeb98c1f754a3ece7ec39bf0b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,84,79,195,118,143,206,235,152,193,247,84,163,236,231,236,57,191,11,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
