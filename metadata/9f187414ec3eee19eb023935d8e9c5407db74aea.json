One half, boosted by dazzling high technology, shows brilliant results in handling acute diseases and emergencies. The other half, dealing with chronic degenerative conditions is lagging behind, unable to offer more than symptomatic treatment for the most widespread distressing conditions, ranging from cancer, heart disease and hypertension to diabetes, arthritis, morbid obesity and many more. It is assumed that these and other â€œdiseases of modern civilizationâ€ are both inevitable and incurable.\r\n\r\nThis book contradicts all such assumptions. As a complete guide to the theory and practice of the Gerson Therapy, developed over eighty years ago by Dr. Max Gerson, M.D., (1881-1959), it shows that the increasingly denatured, nutritionally empty, toxic modern diet is the main cause of todayâ€™s worsening health crisis. â€œHealing the Gerson Wayâ€ offers the solution, in the form of a brilliant, precision-built nutritional program that eliminates the underlying causes of disease, leading to lasting cures. This program is best known for its success in curing many types of cancer, but it also has an excellent track record with a large number of other degenerative conditions.\r\n\r\nThese days cancer researchers all over the world produce results that mirror one or another of Dr. Gersonâ€™s discoveries, developed over many years of clinical practice. Unfortunately such partial insights are of little use. The Gerson Therapy, as a proven method of healing contains them allâ€”and more. It is up to the individual, who wants to improve or regain his or her health, to explore and make use of it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f187414ec3eee19eb023935d8e9c5407db74aea","amp;dn":"Healing+the+Gerson+Way+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f187414ec3eee19eb023935d8e9c5407db74aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,24,116,20,236,62,238,25,235,2,57,53,216,233,197,64,125,183,74,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
