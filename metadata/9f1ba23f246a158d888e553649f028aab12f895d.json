The band was active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and had several Australian chart hits during that time, including &quot;Hit and Run&quot;, &quot;Shape I'm In&quot; and &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. The Falcons dissolved in 1981 and the group's biggest Australian hit, 1982's &quot;Taxi Mary&quot;, as well as the New Zealand top ten hit &quot;Walk On By&quot;, were both credited simply to Jo Jo Zep.\n\nThe late 1970s line up of Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons reunited in 2001, and released a new album in 2003.\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f1ba23f246a158d888e553649f028aab12f895d","amp;dn":"Jo+Jo+Zep+%26amp%3B+The+Falcons+-+Im+In+A+Dancing+Mood+%5Brareplop%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f1ba23f246a158d888e553649f028aab12f895d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,27,162,63,36,106,21,141,136,142,85,54,73,240,40,170,177,47,137,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
