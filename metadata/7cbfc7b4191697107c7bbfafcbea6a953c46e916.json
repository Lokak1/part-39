The series stars Michael Chiklis as Tony Scali, a former NYPD detective who is now the police commissioner in the small upstate New York town of Eastbridge, and tends to work through problems with humor and creativity more often than with violence or force. Theresa Saldana plays Rachel Scali, Tony's wife, and Kaj-Erik Eriksen plays their young son, David. Also living with the family in the first season was Rachel's freeloading brother, Arnie Metzger, played by David Paymer. The show focused as much on family situations as it did on police drama. The series often deals with a wide range of topical social issues such as police corruption, racism, homophobia, drug addiction, disabilities, child abuse, illegal immigration, and sexual harassment. The series lasted four and 1/3 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cbfc7b4191697107c7bbfafcbea6a953c46e916","amp;dn":"The+Commish+-+COMPLETE+Season+1+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cbfc7b4191697107c7bbfafcbea6a953c46e916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,191,199,180,25,22,151,16,124,123,191,175,203,234,106,149,60,70,233,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
