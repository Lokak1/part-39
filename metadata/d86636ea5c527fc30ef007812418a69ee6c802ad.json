The album was recorded at Grouse Lodge Studios in Ireland and AIR Studios on London during 2003. The songs featured on Absolution were written whilst Muse toured in support of Origin of Symmetry and Hullabaloo, with some songs such as &quot; Fury&quot; originating as early as early 2000. Rich Costey began producing Absolution after a the tracks &quot; Blackout&quot; and &quot; Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes&quot; were recorded with Paul Reeve, who co-produced Showbiz and John Cornfield, who engineered Showbiz and Orgin of Symmetry. Like the previous Muse album, Orgin of Symmetry, Absolution is influenced by classical composers such as Sergei Rachmaninov and Samuel Barber, whilst &quot;Endlessly&quot; introduces a more electronic sound with songs such as &quot; The Small Print&quot; and &quot; Thoughts of a Dying Atheist&quot; being guitar-led. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musewiki.org/Absolution_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musewiki.org/Absolution_(album)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86636ea5c527fc30ef007812418a69ee6c802ad","amp;dn":"MUSE+-+2003+-+Absolution+-+mp3+-+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86636ea5c527fc30ef007812418a69ee6c802ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,102,54,234,92,82,127,195,14,240,7,129,36,24,166,158,230,200,2,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
