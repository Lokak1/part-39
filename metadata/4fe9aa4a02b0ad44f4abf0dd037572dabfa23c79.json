Cox backs his theory with solid facts and historical evidence. He provides an overview of historic racial migrations, ancient Egypt, India, China, Mexico, Peru, Latin America and South Africa and finally reviews the racial situation in the US. His conclusion is that physical geographical separation, not segregation, is the only guarantee of survival for all nations and races. This edition has been combined with the pamphlet Ã¢â‚¬Å“LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Negro PolicyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which deals with the efforts of leading White Americans such as Abraham, Lincoln James Monroe and also a large number of Negro leaders who were all in favor of the repatriation of Black people to Africa.
