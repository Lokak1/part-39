I had never posted them before as you are aware an extended play (EP) is a vinyl record or CD which contains more music than a single, but is too short to qualify as an LP. Usually, an EP has around 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“28 minutes of music, for this reason they never made it to 4 rare 80s albums series. Vol. 3 is my pick too and a great new wave record.\n\nBone Symphony - It's A Jungle Out There \nLabel: Capitol Records  \nCatalog#: 12CL 322  \nFormat: Vinyl, 12&quot;\n \nCountry: UK \nReleased: 1983 \nGenre: Electronic  \nStyle: New Wave, Synth-pop  \nCredits: Engineer - Joe Chiccarelli \nProducer - Brian Fairweather , Martin Page  \n\n \n Tracklisting:\n\nA1   It's A Jungle Out There (4:59) \n     Engineer - Mick Guzauski  \nA2   Everything I Say Is A Lie (3:53) \nA3   I'll Be There For You (3:57) \nB1   Piece Of My Heart (4:12) \nB2   Dome Of The Spheres (5:29) \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b91a5048b976290bb1ac46b32835f947e5130de","amp;dn":"Rare+80s+EPs+Vol.+3+-+Bone+Symphony+-+Bone+Symphony+EP+%5B1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b91a5048b976290bb1ac46b32835f947e5130de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,145,165,4,139,151,98,144,187,26,196,107,50,131,95,148,126,81,48,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
