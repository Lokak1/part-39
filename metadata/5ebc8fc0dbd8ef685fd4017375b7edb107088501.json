Sled-hauler Sal banks didn't like to have to depend on anyone or anything, but she needed extra muscle to pull a sled on her next cargo run, so she hired Meesha Raschad first and found out he was an off worlder second. Then she was stuck with a heavy cargo load, a late start, and a dangerously inexperienced newbie for a partner. Meanwhile, the Govies were trying to make them forfeit the run, for no reason Sal could figure. But it had something to do with Raschad--who pulled hard and kept his troubles to himself. Which would have worked fine, except that those troubles soon followed him to the dangers of isolated Tumble Town\n\nPlease Seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ebc8fc0dbd8ef685fd4017375b7edb107088501","amp;dn":"Denise+Lopes+Heald+-+Mistwalker+%28mobi%2Cepub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ebc8fc0dbd8ef685fd4017375b7edb107088501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,188,143,192,219,216,239,104,95,212,1,115,117,183,237,177,7,8,133,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
