It was remastered and reissued in 1993 on Black Vinyl Records with another artwork. This is the very rare original mix which sounds totally better than the PVC release.\n\nRecorded in a livingroom on a TEAC 3340S, 4-track tape machine it has been refererred to by some in the press by the grandaddy of D.I.Y. home recording. Self-produced, recorded and packaged on the band's own Black Vinyl Records label. The original LP pressing of 1,000 copies have been known to fetch over $200 a piece, if one can be found. The 15 pop gems embodied here have an innocent charm that received rave reviews in the US and abroad and eventually attracted the attention of Elektra Records. It remains a touchstone in the do-it-yourself craze of home recording and holds up well even amid today's digital technology and remains a testament to what can be achieved with good songwriting on a shoestring budget.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d78f1361d492dda662b53d0bd2e359c9803b6f3","amp;dn":"Shoes+-+Black+Vinyl+Shoes+%5B1977%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d78f1361d492dda662b53d0bd2e359c9803b6f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,120,241,54,29,73,45,218,102,43,83,208,189,46,53,156,152,3,182,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
