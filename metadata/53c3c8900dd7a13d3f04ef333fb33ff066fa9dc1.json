When Shrek married Fiona, the last thing he wanted was to rule Far Far Away, but when his father- in-law, King Harold, suddenly croaks, Shrek is quickly fitted for the crown. Now, unless the reluctant would- be king can find a suitable replacement, he'll be royally screwed for the rest of his days. As if Shrek didn't have enough on his plate, Princess Fiona has another little surprise on the way. Reeling from the duties of running a kingdom and impending fatherhood, Shrek sets off on a quest to find the only other possible heir to the throne, Fiona's long-lost cousin Artie, a medieval high school outcast. While the ogre is away, his old nemesis Prince Charming rears his handsome head and returns to the kingdom of Far Far Away with redemption on his shallow little mind. Even with Donkey and the ever-so-suave Puss In Boots by their side, it's gong to take an ogre-sized effort ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a whole lot of help from Fiona and her band of princesses ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for Shrek and Artie to save the day and find their own &quot;Happily Ever Afters.&quot;\n\nGenre:Adventure | Animation | Comedy | Family | Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53c3c8900dd7a13d3f04ef333fb33ff066fa9dc1","amp;dn":"Shrek+The+Third.1080p.AC+3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ra+y.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53c3c8900dd7a13d3f04ef333fb33ff066fa9dc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,195,200,144,13,215,161,61,63,4,239,51,63,179,63,240,102,250,157,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
