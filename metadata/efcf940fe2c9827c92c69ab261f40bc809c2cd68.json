Uriah Heep's progressive/art rock/heavy metal fusion's distinctive features have always been massive keyboards sound, strong vocal harmonies and (in the early years) David Byron's operatic vocals. Twelve of the band's albums have made it to the UK Albums Chart (Return to Fantasy reached No. 7 in 1975) while of the fifteen Billboard 200 Uriah Heep albums Demons and Wizards was the most successful (#23, 1972). In the late 1970s the band had massive success in Germany, where the &quot;Lady in Black&quot; single was a big hit. Along with Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep has become one of the top bands in the early 70's and also people like to call these four bands &quot;The Big 4&quot; of Hard Rock.\n\nUriah Heep's audience declined by the 1980s, to the point where they became essentially a cult band in the United Kingdom and United States. The band, though, maintains a significant following and performs at arena-sized venues in the Balkans, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Scandinavia. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide with over 4 million sales in the U.S.A. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Members\n\nMick Box - lead guitars (1969Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nTrevor Bolder - bass (1976Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1981, 1983Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nPhil Lanzon - keyboards (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nBernie Shaw - lead vocals (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nRussell Gilbrook - drums, percussion (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efcf940fe2c9827c92c69ab261f40bc809c2cd68","amp;dn":"Uriah+Heep+-+Rainbow+Demon+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B2004%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efcf940fe2c9827c92c69ab261f40bc809c2cd68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,207,148,15,226,201,130,124,146,198,154,178,97,244,11,200,9,194,205,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
