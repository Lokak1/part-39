For years after \nher daughter Bonnie was stolen from her, she \nfought for closure.  But now as she's striving \nto begin anew, she can't shake the feeling that \nsomething terrible is about to happenÃ¢â‚¬â€or maybe \nalready has.  When her mother, Sandra, asks for \nhelp in finding a missing friend named Beth \nAvery, Eve is sure that she's hiding something.  \nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s odd that Sandra would get involved at all, \nand the fact that she adamantly refuses to go to \nthe police for help reinforces EveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suspicions \nthat something is very wrong. Eve learns that \nBeth has been locked away in a mental hospital \nfor years, which makes it even harder to \nunderstand how she could have disappeared. \n\nAs Sandra reluctantly reveals small pieces of \nthe truth about Beth's identity, Eve is shocked \nto discover that their lives are strangely \nentwined, and Beth's disappearance now puts them \nall in grave danger. Desperate, Eve enlists a \nsecret weapon to pick up Beth's trail: rogue \nprofiler, Kendra Michaels. With an uncanny \nability to detect clues and solve puzzles, Kendra \nbegins to uncover the bizarre circumstances of \nBeth's escape from what should have been the \nsafety of her hospital room. Beth is on the run, \nand as her mind clears--detoxing from the drugs \nthat have held her prisoner--she begins to see \nthe threads of a twisted plot within the powerful \nAvery family, threatening to destroy Beth and \nanyone else who might jeopardize the high-stakes \ngame that is already in play. \n\n\n \nSleep No More (Eve Duncan #15)\nBy Iris Johansen   \nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 610","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4dc4b3ed6ee8ac9435e011370a5230c4374912","amp;dn":"Sleep+No+More+%28Eve+Duncan+%2315%29++by+Iris+Johansen++EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4dc4b3ed6ee8ac9435e011370a5230c4374912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,77,196,179,237,110,232,172,148,53,224,17,55,10,82,48,196,55,73,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
