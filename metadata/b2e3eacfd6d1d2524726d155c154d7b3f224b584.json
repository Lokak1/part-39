In HÃƒÂ¸ibyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Ëœperforming live has been the strength of this trio from the start Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it sparks an extra focus, excitement and joy. As the album title suggests Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where everything comes to lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\nWith a highly developed musical understanding between them, onstage these three strong individual personalities are very much a collective, demonstrating an uncanny empathy and a telepathic singular sound like the synaptic firings of one mind. With totally balanced contributions by each band member, the warmth and intensity of the trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magical interaction is captured perfectly on Life to Everything, enhanced by the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin the roundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ set-up of the recording, which as HÃƒÂ¸iby explains, was a deliberate choice Ã¢â‚¬Ëœto provide perfect sightlines and an invisible thread of energy between usÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nOver the nine tracks, each member takes a writing credit for three compositions, yet the undeniable trademark Phronesis sound of catchy hooks, complex changes, crackling rhythms and heady grooves is present throughout Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a testament to their skills as individual composers.\n\nFrom the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbig commanding tone and skittering composureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (New York Times) of HÃƒÂ¸ibyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass at the start of EgerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Urban Control, layered by NeameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inventive melodic piano lines and EgerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relentless creative countercurrents, the sound is instantly recognisable as Phronesis.\n\nLife to Everything has the irresistible excitement, skillful flair and expansive compositional craft that result in undoubtably PhronesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most accomplished artistic statement to date.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
