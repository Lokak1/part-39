Welcome to the World of WeirdÃ¢â‚¬â€better known as my life.\n\nIt wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always like this. I was once a normal high school senior, just filling out college apps and trying to stay sane long enough to get out of Moonlight, Missouri. Preferably before I ended up in a straight-jacket out of sheer boredom.\n\nAt first, my only problems were my increasingly unwanted ability to see the dead and my desperation to remove the stalker known as my ex-boyfriend from my life. Somewhere along the line I must have pissed off the Bad Karma Fairy. Maybe I stepped on the wrong toadstool or peed in LokiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal swimming poolÃ¢â‚¬â€I really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know. All I do know is IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m about to have the worst week of my life. Maybe the worst week of any teenagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. Ever.\n\nAll because of a dead guy.\n\nFrom the second pale, too-hot-to-be-real Nathan Ashley stepped out of the wreckage of his mangled sports car, my life spiraled into complete and utter chaos. One minute, I'm quasi-normal, the next IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m being kidnapped by a vampire, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m having weird, creepy powers sprout up out of nowhere, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m running from a demon who wants to get more familiar with my anatomyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or kill me. Again. Yeah, did I mention he's done it before?\n\nAnybody know if those straight-jackets come in pink?\n\nGenre: Young Adult, Paranormal Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1dbca474599de6984831ec312713a052c4ce00c","amp;dn":"Something+Witchy+by+AJ+Myers+%28Mystics+%26amp%3B+Mayhem+%231%29.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1dbca474599de6984831ec312713a052c4ce00c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,219,202,71,69,153,222,105,132,131,30,195,18,113,58,5,44,76,224,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
