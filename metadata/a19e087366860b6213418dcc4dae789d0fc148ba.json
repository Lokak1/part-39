Shy Norman is reluctant at first, but with the help of his mother -- with whom he shares an intensely close relationship -- the boy begins to open up to others and make new friends. Some locals, however, aren't as friendly and welcoming to the Bates, who discover that because White Pine Bay isn't as peaceful as it appears, they are forced to do whatever it takes to survive. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19e087366860b6213418dcc4dae789d0fc148ba","amp;dn":"Bates+Motel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19e087366860b6213418dcc4dae789d0fc148ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,158,8,115,102,134,11,98,19,65,141,204,77,174,120,157,15,193,72,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
