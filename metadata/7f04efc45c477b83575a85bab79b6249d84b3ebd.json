Finally I gave up trying to decipher the protection scheme (which was written by a paranoid freak and is hidden in 100+ places inside the app) I manualy enabled some of the disabled functionality by overwriting a useless piece of the original code :-D It is dirty but I think it got the job done.\n\nI am especially proud of this baby - enjoy!\n\nOriginal website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kinemac.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kinemac.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKinemac\nis a 3D Real Time Animation &amp; Presentation Software for Mac OS X.

See the animations in our Gallery.\n\nJust drag your images, texts, movies and songs onto the Kinemac stage to get them into your animation. Kinemac allows you to apply images and movies onto the readyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“to-use objects like cubes, cylinders, spheres, tubes, pies, rectangles, disks... which you can easily animate by setting key frames. Also, it lets you quickly create 3D Text and 2D scrolling text (RTF and RTFD) with any kind of font, color, size, shadows, embedded images... Take a look at the tutorials and see how easy it is to use Kinemac.\n\nA powerful animation control system based on Bezier curves allows you to carefully control any aspect of the movement such as translations, rotations, resizing, fading, speed, acceleration and deceleration of any object on the stage. The result is a professional and smooth animation which you can play in Real-Time/Full-Screen or export to a QuickTime movie file.\n\nKinemac uses the latest technologies like the OpenGL engine, QuickTime and the Cocoa frameworks, making it the ideal application to create Advertising for TV, trailers for movies, video-clips, instant scrolling messaging to put &quot;on air&quot; in real time, video content for CD, DVD, web sites... Also it has been said &quot;awesome&quot; to illustrate concepts through 3D animations at conferences, schools and universities.
