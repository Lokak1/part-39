The show has attained an iconic status in the United States, with the Cleavers exemplifying the idealized suburban family of the mid-twentieth century.\n\nLeave It to Beaver is a glimpse at middle class American boyhood. A typical episode features Beaver getting into some sort of trouble and facing his parents for reprimand and correction. It is unique in that the stories were told from the child&amp;#039;s point of view. Beaver Cleaver was 7 when the series began, and his brother Wally, 12. Beaver was a typically rambunctious youth, more interested in pet frogs than in girls, but Wally, just entering his teens, was beginning to discover other things in life. The counterpoint between the two, plus some good writing and acting, lent the series its charm. Beaver and Wally&amp;#039;s parents, June and Ward Cleaver, were your everyday 1950&amp;#039;s parents, loving and wise, who did their best at trying to understand, support, and guide Beaver and Wally as they grew up.\n\nThis series was truly an original, and very much ahead of its time in that it showed the world through the eyes of a young boy, and sometimes dealt with rather controversial subjects. One episode dealt frankly with the subject of alcoholism; another showed how divorce can affect a child.\n\nOne thing that is not well-known about Leave It To Beaver is that it was the first American television show to be broadcast behind the Iron Curtain. (Those of you too young to remember the Iron Curtain - google it!) That would explain why Ward always wore a suit to dinner, and why June was always dressed perfectly, even when she was doing housework. It also explains why there are so many references to God, Sunday School, breaking bread, etc. \n\nLITB never made it into the Nielson top 30, but it had solid ratings throughout it&amp;#039;s six season run. The show received two Emmy nominations in 1958 for Best New Program Series of the Year and Best Teleplay Writing - Half Hour or Less (Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher) for the premiere episode, &quot;Beaver Gets &amp;#039;Spelled&quot;. Leave It to Beaver has been placed on Time&amp;#039;s &quot;The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time&quot; list.
