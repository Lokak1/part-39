From electrophysiology and cell biology, to animal models and gene therapy, this comprehensive set of methods provides the step-by-step instructions needed for investigators to incorporate new approaches into their research programs. Specific protocols describe new techniques for diagnosis, in vitro methods for the expression and functional analysis of CFTR, novel biochemical and cellular systems to determine how mutations subvert CFTR function, and in vivo protocols to examine how CFTR dysfunction produce multisystem pathology in both human and animal models.
