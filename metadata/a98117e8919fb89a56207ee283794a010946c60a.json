Better than my dvdrip. Quality achieved at a standard filesize, going for a higher filesize is already a waste of bandwidth.\nContinuing to provide QUALITY which is our priority. Special filters used which takes a lot of time to encode. For those who wait you know what your getting and we dont disappoint.\nThis release has been encoded to be 100% compatible to all players.\nColors, brightness and contrast untouched same as source. We do not touch source to preserve the picture the way it was intended to be shown.\nStandard filesize implemented to make this release DVD burn friendly.\nThis release has been burned and tested to play on a standalone divx player.\nFor best results play on:\nPC - KMPlayer (ver. 2.9.4.1435)\nPS3\nXBOX 360\nPopcorn Hour\nDivx standalone player\nWD TV HD media player\nNew!
