It includes a cover of Elton John&amp;#039;s hit Saturday Night&amp;#039;s Alright for Fighting. The band opened for King Diamond in America. Also toured with Megadeth, Testament and Sanctuary (band) in Europe on the &quot;So Far, So Good. So What&quot; tour.\n\nFifteen months later, they got a deal with MCA and began to work on their third album When the Storm Comes Down, which was released in 1990. The band expected to gain recognition with this album, but it suffered from a poor production and a weaker songwriting as compared to their first two albums.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Flotsam and Jetsam - No Place For Disgrace\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Flotsam and Jetsam\nAlbum................: No Place For Disgrace\nGenre................: \nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: \nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 72 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, MD5, M3U, LOG, CUE\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
