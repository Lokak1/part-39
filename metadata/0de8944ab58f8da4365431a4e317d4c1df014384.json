It appears as the lead\ntrack on their 1971 album of the same name.\n\nThe original recording of the song, over ten minutes long, features little\nmore than a spoken introduction and a much-praised extended guitar solo by\nEddie Hazel. Music critic Greg Tate described the song as Funkadelic's A\nLove Supreme; the song is #60 on the Rolling Stone list of 100 Greatest\nGuitar Songs.\n\n&quot;Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time, for y'all have knocked her\nup. I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe - I was not\noffended, for I knew I had to rise above it all, or drown in my own shit.&quot;\n\nThe song comes along as a carefully 'refreshed' wave file, using Steinberg\nWavelab, Adobe Audition and Audacity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de8944ab58f8da4365431a4e317d4c1df014384","amp;dn":"Funkadelic+-+Maggot+Brain+%281971%29+WAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0de8944ab58f8da4365431a4e317d4c1df014384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,232,148,74,181,143,141,164,54,84,49,164,227,23,212,193,223,1,67,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
