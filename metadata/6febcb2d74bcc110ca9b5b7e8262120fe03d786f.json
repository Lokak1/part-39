Her fame has transcended the usual boundaries of classical music, and she has been the inspiration for several movies, an opera, and a successful Broadway musical. Her extensive catalogue of recordings remains among the most coveted and controversial for both her fans and detractors.\n\nThough American by birth, Callas (born Maria Anne Sofia Cecilia Kalogeropoulos) was born of Greek parents, and at age 13 her mother took her back to Greece because of financial difficulties caused by the Great Depression. She studied voice at the Royal Academy of Music in Athens with Spanish coloratura soprano Elvira de Hildago and made rapid progress; she soon sang Santuzza in a student production of Cavalleria rusticana. Her professional debut came at age 16 in a minor role in Suppe's Bocaccio. \n\nMaria Callas was one of the most controversial singers of the twentieth century. She had a wide range from high E to the F below the staff, and an innate feel for the style of bel canto roles, but she was most notable for bringing a commitment and intensity to her dramatic portrayals that was nearly unprecedented at the time. By 1957, her voice developed a wobble which grew worse in the following years. Always a perfectionist, she was very difficult to deal with from a management point of view: she was fired from the Metropolitan Opera in 1958 and she was estranged from Teatro alla Scala for several years. Her vocal decline coincided with the dissolution of her first marriage to Giovanni Meneghini and her affair with Aristotle Onassis. \n\n\n\nGenre................: Classical\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: EMI Classics\nIncluded.............: Covers, Spectrograms, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1\n\n01.Vissi D'Arte\n02.Un Bel Di Vedremo\n03.La Mamma Morta\n04.Una Voce Poco Fa\n05.Come Per Me Sereno\n06.Caro Nome\n07.Ah, Fors'ÃƒÂ¨ Lui\n08.In Quelle Trine Morbide\n09.SÃƒÂ¬.
