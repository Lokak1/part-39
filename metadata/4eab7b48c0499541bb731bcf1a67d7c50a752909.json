They compose a new kind of world music, sometimes called ethnic electronica, mixing ethnic with electronic sounds and dance beats or chillout beats. Their sound has been described as an &quot;ethno-introspective ambient world music&quot;. They were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1993 for Best World Music Album, and in 1996 they won the Award for the album Boheme. The group also became World Music Awards Winner - French group with the highest 1995 world sales. Their albums have sold over 10 million copies.\n\nOfficial website of the Group: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.deepforestmusic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.deepforestmusic.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nAn album Kusa No Ran (Soundtrack; 2004; lossless; FLAC+working CUEsheet)\n\nKusa No Ran is Deep Forest&amp;#039;s second full-length soundtrack. This independent Japanese film is about the historical revolt of 1884 in the Chichibu region of Japan. Though it was an indi-flick, over 8,000 extras came from across Japan to take part in the large battle scenes.\n\nThe soundtrack is composed of 23, mostly very short, pieces. All the songs are instrumental, with the exception for Eternal Dream. There are few ethnic influences other than some drumming, instead the music is more classical with a number of piano and violin songs. An unusual aspect of this album is the fact that only two of the songs are composed by Michel Sanchez. This soundtrack was only released in Japan.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
