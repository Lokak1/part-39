Released in 1985 on the Alternative Tentacles Label, founded by the frontman for Dead Kennedys, Jello Biafra. \n\nFrankchrist is musically different from Dead Kennedys' other albums. It's less raw punk; the songs are longer and with much more elaborate arrangement. The lyrics are significantly more focused and pointed. This is the album where they hit their stride. \n\nNote: This torrent is missing the second track titled &quot;Untitled.&quot; This is because any work titled &quot;Untitled&quot; is an absolute bitch to find and I could not. I have never heard the song and am of the belief its absence does not interfere with the album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fea497c35d464a1904b27add7660696a52da3127","amp;dn":"Dead+Kennedys+-+Frankenchrist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fea497c35d464a1904b27add7660696a52da3127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,164,151,195,93,70,74,25,4,178,122,221,118,96,105,106,82,218,49,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
