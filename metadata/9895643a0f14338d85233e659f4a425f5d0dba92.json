Later that year they released a second live album, Made in America, which featured the Top 40 track, &quot;Who's Making Love&quot;.[37]\n\nThe songs on the soundtrack album are a noticeably different audio mix than in the film, with a prominent baritone saxophone in the horn line (also heard in the film during &quot;Shake a Tail Feather&quot;, though no bari sax is present), and female backing vocals on &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;, though the band had no backup singers in the film. A number of regular Blues Brothers' members, including saxophonist Tom Scott and drummer Steve Jordan, perform on the soundtrack album but are not in the film.\n\n\n\n Cd Informations\n******************\n\n\nFormat: Mp3\nSound: Stereo 128 Kbps\nNo Of Tracks: 11\nReleased: June 20, 1980\nGenre: Blues | blues-rock | blue-eyed | soul\nLength \t40:27\nCovers: Front | Back | Inside\n\n\n\n\n Track List\n************\n\n\n\n1.&quot;She Caught the Katy&quot; - 4:10\n2.&quot;Peter Gunn Theme&quot; - 3:46\n3.&quot;Gimme Some Lovin&quot; - 3:06\n4.&quot;Shake a Tail Feather&quot; - 2:48\n5.&quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot; - 3:21\n6.&quot;The Old Landmark&quot; - 2:56\n7.&quot;Think&quot;  - 3:13\n8.&quot;Theme from Rawhide&quot; - 2:37\n9.&quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; - 3:23\n10.&quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; - 7:48\n11.&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;  - 3:19\n\n\n\n\n                     Enjoy and Please don't forget to seed..!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9895643a0f14338d85233e659f4a425f5d0dba92","amp;dn":"The.Blues.Brothers-Original.Soundtrack.Recording.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9895643a0f14338d85233e659f4a425f5d0dba92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,149,100,58,15,20,51,141,133,35,62,101,159,74,66,95,93,13,186,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
