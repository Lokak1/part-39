The Wide World Over: A 40-Year Celebration gathers into a single collection some of the Irish ensemble's most memorable moments, including predictable alliances with artists such as Van Morrison, who sings &quot;Shenandoah&quot; to additional backing by the Irish Film Orchestra, and unlikely pairings like the Rolling Stones, who add a rock kick and the &quot;Satisfaction&quot; riff to &quot;The Rocky Road to Dublin.&quot; Cross-cultural experts Linda Ronstadt and Los Lobos demonstrate their versatility on the Mexican ditties &quot;Txalaparta&quot; and &quot;Guadalupe,&quot; on which pipes and pennywhistle don't seem a whisker out of place, while Ricky Skaggs points to the Irish and British roots of American country music on the rousing &quot;Cotton-Eyed Joe.&quot; Art Garfunkel, Sting, Sinead O'Connor, Joni Mitchell, and Elvis Costello are also featured in classic performances with the 40-year-old Irish band, while a brand-new collaboration with Ziggy Marley yields a gorgeous Don Was-produced rendition of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song.&quot; The clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© that there's a bit of the Irish in all of us proves true in this wide-ranging, constantly rewarding, and frequently surprising collection. And the tracks on which the Chieftains go it alone are also a gas.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n      \n[01] Medley: March of the King of Laois / Paddy's Jig / O'Keefe's - The Chattering Magpie (Reels)\n[02] The Foggy Dew \t\t- (With Sinead O'Connor)   \n[03] I Know My Love \t\t- (With The Corrs)\n[04] Cotton Eyed Joe \t\t- (With Ricky Skaggs)\n[05] The Magdalene Laundries \t- (With Joni Mitchell)\n[06] Live From Matt Molloy's Pub\n[07] Shenandoah (With Van Morrison)\n[08] Medley: The Munster Cloak/An Poc Ar Buille/Ferney Hill/Little Molly\n[09] Morning Has Broken \t\t- (With Diana Krall and Art Garfunkel)\n[10] Morning Dew/Women of Ireland \t- (The Love Theme from Barry Lyndon)\n[11] Mo Ghile Mear \t\t- (With Sting)\n[12] Carolyn's Concerto\n[13] Guadalupe \t\t\t- (With Linda Rondstadt)\n[14] Full of Joy \t\t\t- (With Chinese Ensemble)\n[15] Here's A Health To The Company\n[16] Chasing The Fox \t\t- (With Cincinnati Pops Orchestra)\n[17] Long Journey Home \t\t- (With Elvis Costello)\n[18] The Rocky Road To Dublin  \n[19] Redemption Song \t\t- (With Ziggy Marley) \n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:11m:26s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 187mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.5.0.20 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Folk Celtic Traditional Instrumental\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 05 March 2002\n\nRecords Company    \t- RCA Victor\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.thechieftains.com \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a033d2358a4ac6be2015ea81391429d2536b6266","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+The+Wide+World+Over+-+The+Chieftains+-+187mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a033d2358a4ac6be2015ea81391429d2536b6266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,51,210,53,138,74,198,190,32,21,234,129,57,20,41,210,83,107,98,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
