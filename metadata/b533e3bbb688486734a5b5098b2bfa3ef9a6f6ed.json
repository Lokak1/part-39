With full-throated, empathetic vocals throughout I'm Still the Same, Bramlett connects a variety of pop traditions, from jump blues to gauzy romantic balladry, and makes it all work. Her ability to read a lyric on tunes like &quot;Hurt&quot; compares to that of Dinah Washington, and not unfavorably. At medium tempos, such as the Santana-style samba of &quot;What If,&quot; Bramlett sings comfortably around the beat, working the tension between the steady pulse and her more rubato phrasing. She's strongest, however, when the groove is slow; the 6/8 crawl of &quot;No Man's Land,&quot; for example, lets her draw full dramatic effect from the lyric, especially on long notes that she can twist, stretch, and milk dry through a carefully controlled vibrato, subtle timbral variation, and other tools of expression. And her wrenching, intimate revival of &quot;Superstar,&quot; sweetened by Mickey Raphael's haunting harmonica fills, will induce chills, whether you remember the '70s or not.
