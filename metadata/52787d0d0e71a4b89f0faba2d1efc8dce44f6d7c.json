The reason : he has a great sense of music, combining strong and\ncreative melodic approaches with rhythmic inventiveness, without losing touch\nwith the jazz tradition, and above all : the emotional power of his alto is\nprobably the greatest fun. His ensemble for this album consists of Craig Taborn\non piano and electronics, William Parker on bass and Gerald Cleaver on\ndrums. The first track &quot;Rocking Horse&quot;, sucks the listener headfirst into\nBrown's universe, with a strong bass vamp, great drumming by Cleaver, wonderful\nand sometimes eery accents by Taborn, and with Brown soaring above, through and\nunder the music. It's the first time Brown records with a pianist in one of his\nown bands (not taking his duets with Shipp into account), and the collaboration\nworks well, especially because Brown's themes are often strange, with high\nintervallic jumps, as on &quot;Clearly Speaking&quot;, but in unison with the keyboards\nthe result is excellent. On &quot;Sonic Ecosystem&quot;, the slow theme is played by sax\nand arco bass in together from beginning to end, above Taborn's changing\nelectronic tapestry, subtly supported by Cleaver. More than on his other\nalbum's, Brown compositional skills come to the fore, without relinquishing the\nnecessary freedom to make his music breathe and live. Especially the last\ntrack, &quot;Worlds Spinning&quot; is worth mentioning, because of the totally free\nmiddle part, in which Parker's arco creates a great musical environment for\nBrown's free and sensitive blowing. And that's when I find this band is\nstrongest : when the music is open-ended and not too much orchestrated.\n\n--\n\nBy Brian Morton &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD17/PoD17MoreMoments2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD17/PoD17MoreMoments2.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28597&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28597&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Lyn Horton &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28863&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28863&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor YahvÃƒÂ© M. de la Cavada (es)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52787d0d0e71a4b89f0faba2d1efc8dce44f6d7c","amp;dn":"Rob+Brown+Ensemble+-+Crown+Trunk+Root+Funk+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52787d0d0e71a4b89f0faba2d1efc8dce44f6d7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,120,125,13,14,113,164,184,159,15,171,162,209,239,200,220,228,79,109,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
