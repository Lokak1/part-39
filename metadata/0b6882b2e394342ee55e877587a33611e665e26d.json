Now a major motion picture, The Cost of Sugar gives an engrossing account of eighteenth century Suriname at the time when the country was ruled by the Dutch. The hypocrisies behind the veneer of a respectable colonial life are revealed through the eyes of two Jewish step sisters, Elza and Sarith, descendants of the settlers of New Jerusalem of the River' known today as Jodensavanne. Their pampered existences become intertwined with the fate of the plantations as the slaves decide to fight against the violent repression they have endured for too long... Cynthia McLeod presents a frank exposÃƒÂ© of life in a Dutch colony when sugar was king and demanded the consummate allegiance of all - colonists and slaves - regardless of the tragic consequence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6882b2e394342ee55e877587a33611e665e26d","amp;dn":"Cynthia+McLeod+-+The+Cost+of+Sugar+%28retail%29+%28epub%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6882b2e394342ee55e877587a33611e665e26d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,104,130,178,227,148,52,46,229,94,135,117,135,163,54,17,230,101,226,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
