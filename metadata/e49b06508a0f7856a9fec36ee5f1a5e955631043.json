Sure, her quirky mom owns an occult shop, and a nerd just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop trying to be her friend, but Indie is a popular cheerleader with a football-star boyfriend and a social circle powerful enough to ruin everyone at school. Who wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be her?\n\nThen a guy dies right before her eyes. And the dusty old family Bible her mom is freakishly possessive of is stolen. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when a frustratingly sexy stranger named Bishop enters IndieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world that she learns her destiny involves a lot more than pom-poms and parties. If she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the Bible back, every witch on the planet will die. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seriously bad news for Indie, because according to Bishop, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a witch too.\n\nSuddenly forced into a centuries-old war between witches and sorcerers, IndieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to uncover the many dark truths about her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and a future unlike any she ever imagined on top of the cheer pyramid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e49b06508a0f7856a9fec36ee5f1a5e955631043","amp;dn":"Hexed+by+Michelle+Krys++%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e49b06508a0f7856a9fec36ee5f1a5e955631043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,155,6,80,138,15,120,86,169,254,195,110,229,241,165,233,85,99,16,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
