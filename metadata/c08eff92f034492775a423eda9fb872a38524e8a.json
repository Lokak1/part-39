B. Sweeney (Roommates, Memphis Belle) star as polar opposites who unite on the ice for a shot at Olympic gold in this inspirational romantic comedy from acclaimed director Paul M. Glaser (The Running Man).

He's a brash, blue-collar hockey champion with a new injury and no future. With nothing in common but their dream of reaching the Olympics, Kate and Doug are each other's last resort. Reluctantly, they join forces, but its not long before the barbs - and sparks - start flying as the unlikely pair skate towards the opportunity of a lifetime: a chance at a medal... and a chance at love.\n\n\nRelease Date: 1992\nMPAA Rating: PG\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08eff92f034492775a423eda9fb872a38524e8a","amp;dn":"The+Cutting+Edge+%281992%29+DVD5.NTSC.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08eff92f034492775a423eda9fb872a38524e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,142,255,146,240,52,73,39,117,164,35,237,169,251,135,42,56,82,78,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
