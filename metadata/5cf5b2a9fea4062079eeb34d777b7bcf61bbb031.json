Someone is killing off the world's most gifted\nneurosurgeons, and Alex Bishop, a renegade CIA agent, thinks he knows who it is.\nBishop is out to settle his score with Claude Malloche, an international\nassassin responsible for the death of Bishop's brother. When he learns that\nMalloche is afflicted with an inoperable brain tumor, Bishop understands why the\nmurdered neurosurgeons died, and where Malloche will strike next. Meanwhile,\nJessie Copeland, an MIT-trained mechanical engineer and neurosurgeon, is working\nto perfect a robotic device that will revolutionize brain surgery.  One of the\npatients awaiting surgery at Boston's Eastern Massachusetts Medical Center is \nMalloche--but which one? No one has ever been able to identify the assassin, and\nJessie is hardly well known enough to attract his notice. But ARTIE, the robotic\ndevice, is--and Malloche will stop at nothing to ensure that it's used to save\nhis own life. He threatens to release a deadly nerve toxin on thousands of\ninnocent people, and Jessie is forced to save him at the cost of her own safety.\nNotable for his swift pacing, well-drawn minor as well as major characters, and\nmedicalexpertise, Palmer delivers the goods with this heart-stopping read. \n                                       *****Amazon.com\n********************************************************************************\n\nEnjoy it!
