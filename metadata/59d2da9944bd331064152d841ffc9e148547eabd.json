The student gets embroiled in the Temple\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s fight with an ex-disciple, a covert Lama monk, who stole the secret Shaolin fighting manual 12 years earlier. The Lama monk returns and attacks the temple for sheltering a beautiful girl he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s trying to kill or marry. There a comedic monk involved also.\nThe b-grade kungfu movies are a genre on their own. What makes this one stand above is the fact it has a great story and even better fighting scenes. Pretty hard to find these days but well worth watching if you enjoy this type of movie. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d2da9944bd331064152d841ffc9e148547eabd","amp;dn":"Shaolin+vs+Lama+%5Bby+Crazy+Ace%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d2da9944bd331064152d841ffc9e148547eabd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,210,218,153,68,189,51,16,100,21,45,132,31,252,158,20,133,71,234,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
