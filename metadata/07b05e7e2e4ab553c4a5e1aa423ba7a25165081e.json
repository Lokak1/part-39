Setio and his wife Siti, own a pottery business in a small village ran by Ludiro, a powerful and ruthless businessman. Ludiro, who is in love with Siti, seizes his chance when the couple's business collapses. He abducts and tries to seduce Siti. The two men fight and inevitably jealousy spills over into violence and tragedy.

The closest comparison I can think of is a film like Operetta Tanuki Goten, except much less whimsical. Others have drawn comparisons to the films of Matthew Barney and Paradjanov's Sayat Nova. It's best to approach Opera Jawa less as a film and more as a modernist re-imagining of the Javanese dance-drama artform. Like a dance-drama, narrative form is sacrificed to focus on the aesthetics of dance and musical performance, because one is expected to already be familiar with the story. This approach is even a bit of a departure for Garin Nugroho, whose films have long been successful in the festival circuit, but this is the first film of his to be released on DVD as far as I know.[/QUOTE]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard01-72.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard01-72.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard02-75.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard02-75.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard03-74.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard03-74.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard04-61.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard04-61.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard05-48.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard05-48.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard06-34.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard06-34.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard07-6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i58/lord_terabyte/Clipboard07-6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------my rip, one of my first--------\n\nThis is one of the best movies I've ever seen!\n\n~~~~~~ Opera Jawa.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,336,350,720                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type:......................................AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype:........................................OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):.............................40          \nPreload (in ms):................................448       \nAudio alignment:................................Split         \nNumber of Audio Streams:........................1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                             \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:55:28                \nFrame Count:....................................173186             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................384                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.833                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1341                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.198&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
