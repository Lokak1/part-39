It is good - and fun too.\n\n\nInfo\n\nAn American Film Festival Award winner, this 13 volume series attempts a massive survey of science, from flint tools to the theory of relativity. The series, a co-production of the BBC and Time-Life Films was made as a science counterpart to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½CivilizationÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½. It is given superb technical support, with two crews using innovative filming techniques, shooting in 27 countries. Dr. Jacob Bronowski makes for an unorthodox narrator, his non-scripted delivery ranging from hushed awe to trembling passion. He uses the crawling infant, the performing athlete, the development of the hunt and the discovery of fire to illustrate the most distinctive feature of man: imagination. His Scientific-Humanism is often spectacular, always provocative.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e061cae926b4b69f03588ef9b9d09e7a880434","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Ascent+of+Man%2C+Documentary%2C+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e061cae926b4b69f03588ef9b9d09e7a880434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,224,97,202,233,38,180,182,159,3,88,142,249,185,208,158,122,136,4,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
