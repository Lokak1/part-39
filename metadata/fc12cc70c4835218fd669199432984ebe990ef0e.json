The expansion of solids, liquids, and gases is compared. A discussion on specific heat capacity leads to the physics of a freezing lake. Demonstrations using liquid nitrogen show the effects of low temperatures. Segment length: 44 minutes\n    Heat Transfer: Conduction is related to many everyday examples and is demonstrated by boiling water under a variety of conditions. Convection is shown with a pressure cooker. Radiation is related to Newton's law of cooling. Segment length: 45 minutes\n    Heat Radiation: The temperature dependence of radiation frequencies are related to the greenhouse effect. The way in which sunlight spreads differently over parts of the earth helps explain the warmth of the equatorial regions and coolness of polar regions. Segment length: 32 minutes\n    Heat: Change of State The concepts of evaporation and condensation are contrasted. The energy transfer that accompanies changes of state is related to everyday examples. Segment length: 46 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc12cc70c4835218fd669199432984ebe990ef0e","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Physics+Alive%21+-+Volume+7+-+Heat%2C+Temperature%2C+Expans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc12cc70c4835218fd669199432984ebe990ef0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,18,204,112,196,131,82,24,253,102,145,153,67,41,132,235,233,144,239,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
