The first of these fantasies, THE CLOVEN VISCOUNT (1952), is an allegorical story of a man split in two -- a good half and an evil half -- by a cannon shot; he becomes whole through his love for a peasant girl.  The second and most highly praised fantasy, THE BARON IN THE TREES (1957), is a whimsical tale of a 19th-century nobleman who one day decides to climb into the trees and who never sets foot on the ground again.  From the trees he does, however, participate fully in the affairs of his fellow men below.  The tale wittily explores the interaction and tension between reality and imagination.  The third fantasy, THE NONEXISTENT KNIGHT (1959), is a mock epic chivalric tale.\r\n\r\nAmong Calvinoâ€™s later works of fantasy is COSMICOMICS (1965), a stream-of-consciousness narrative that treats the creation and evolution of the universe.  In the later novels INVISIBLE CITIES (1972), THE CASTLE OF CROSSED DESTINIES (1973), and IF ON A WINTERâ€™S NIGHT A TRAVELER (1979), Calvino uses playfully innovative structures and shifting viewpoints in order to examine the nature of chance, coincidence, and change.\r\n\r\nAlso included here are several collections of essays, letters, and autobiographical writings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise indicated:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     == FICTION ==\r\n\r\n* Adam, One Afternoon (Vintage, 2000)\r\n\r\n* The Baron in the Trees (Harcourt, 1977)\r\n\r\n* The Castle of Crossed Destinies (Vintage, 1998)\r\n\r\n* The Cloven Viscount (Harcourt, 2012)\r\n\r\n* The Complete Cosmicomics (Penguin, 2010)\r\n\r\n* Difficult Loves (Vintage, 1999)\r\n\r\n* Fantastic Tales: Visionary and Everyday [ed.] (Vintage, 1998)\r\n\r\n* If on a winter's night a traveller (Vintage, 1998)\r\n\r\n* Invisible Cities (Vintage, 1997)\r\n\r\n* Italian Folktales (Harcourt, 1980)\r\n\r\n* Marcovaldo (Vintage, 2001)\r\n\r\n* Mr Palomar (Vintage, 1999)\r\n\r\n* The Nonexistent Knight (Harcourt, 2012)\r\n\r\n* Numbers in the Dark &amp; Other Stories (Vintage, 1995)\r\n\r\n* Our Ancestors: The Cloven Viscount / The Baron in the Trees / The Nonexistent Knight (Vintage, 1998)\r\n\r\n* The Path to the Nest of Spiders (Ecco, 1976)\r\n\r\n* The Path to the Spiders' Nests [revised edition] (Ecco, 1998) -- PDF\r\n\r\n* The Queen's Necklace (Penguin, 2011)\r\n\r\n* t zero (Harcourt, 2012)\r\n\r\n* Under the Jaguar Sun (Harcourt, 2012)\r\n\r\n* The Watcher &amp; Other Stories (Harcourt, 1971)\r\n\r\n\r\n                         == ESSAYS, LETTERS &amp; NON-FICTION ==\r\n\r\n* The Art of Fiction, No. 130 (Paris Review, Fall 1992).
