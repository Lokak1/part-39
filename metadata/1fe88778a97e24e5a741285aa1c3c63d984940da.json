But in October 2008, less than   \n  a decade after Fred Goodwin took over as chief executive, it came     \n  within hours of collapsing. RBS later posted the biggest loss in UK   \n  corporate history - 24 billion pounds - which damaged the bank's      \n  reputation for financial prudence and Scotland's image as a global    \n  financial centre. Using previously unbroadcast footage of the bank's  \n  top executives and interviews with bank insiders, this documentary    \n  tells the compelling story of a national catastrophe.                 \n                                                                        \n  Enjoy the look at BBCs interpretation of the UK bank crisis!          \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a3d497c5c0d1c6d4e3c4cec2cacf8dc0ccce&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe88778a97e24e5a741285aa1c3c63d984940da","amp;dn":"RBS.Inside.the.Bank.That.Ran.Out.of.Money.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe88778a97e24e5a741285aa1c3c63d984940da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,232,135,120,169,126,36,229,167,65,40,90,161,195,198,61,152,73,64,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
