Walled in on almost all sides by water, pressed together by the demands and dangers of geography, the crowded streets of New Orleans have always been a laboratory where the social forces that characterize American life play out in dramatic and, at times, disastrous fashion.\n\nOver the course of two provocative hours, American Experience tells the story of this remarkable city. Focusing primarily on the century from Reconstruction to school desegregation in the 1960s, the film offers a portrait of New Orleans that both explores its unique and distinctive culture and illuminates its central place on the American landscape.\n\nFeaturing the city\\&amp;#039;s rich archival resources and a remarkable collection of on-camera commentators, the film also includes a series of veritÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©-style portraits of New Orleans residents. The resulting cinematic narrative is a dialogue between past and present that highlights New Orleans\\&amp;#039; particular brand of humor, fatalism, and wry rebelliousness, while raising critical questions about what lies ahead for the city and the nation.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/neworleans/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/neworleans/index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3369d09ffd7ca52fed32fc5cdd8258c1ff5a117","amp;dn":"American.Experience.New.Orleans.2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3369d09ffd7ca52fed32fc5cdd8258c1ff5a117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,54,157,9,255,215,202,82,254,211,47,197,205,216,37,140,31,245,161,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
