Naterer, Ibrahim Dincer, Calin Zamfirescu (Springer, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4471-4937-8\r\n\r\nWith the resurgence of nuclear power around the world, and the increasingly important role of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier, the utilization of nuclear energy for large-scale hydrogen production will have a key role in a sustainable energy future. Co-generation of both electricity and hydrogen from nuclear plants will become increasingly attractive. It enables load leveling together with renewable energy and storage of electricity in the form of hydrogen, when electricity prices and demand are lowest at off-peak hours of nuclear plants, such as overnight.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHydrogen Production from Nuclear Energy provides an overview of the latest developments and methods of nuclear based hydrogen production, including electrolysis and thermochemical cycles. Particular focus is given to thermochemical water splitting by the copper-chlorine and sulphur-based cycles. Cycle configurations, equipment design, modeling and implementation issues are presented and discussed. The book provides the reader with an overview of the key enabling technologies towards the design and industrialization of hydrogen plants that are co-located and linked with nuclear plants in the future.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe book includes illustrations of technology developments, tables that summarize key features and results, overviews of recent advances and new methods of nuclear hydrogen production. The latest results from leading authorities in the fields will be presented, including efficiencies, costs, equipment design, and modeling","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ca07aa85fad5c9c120f4f817d66b376e4fa3a8","amp;dn":"Hydrogen+Production+from+Nuclear+Energy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ca07aa85fad5c9c120f4f817d66b376e4fa3a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,202,7,170,133,250,213,201,193,32,244,248,23,214,107,55,110,79,163,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
