As of December 2007, it has sold 488,000 copies in the United States.\n\nAmazon Review By Brian D. Rubendall - As single discs Best Of albums go, Joni Mitchell's &quot;Hits&quot; is very well done, collecting 15 of the best and most well known songs of Mitchell's long career. Mitchell is primarily known as a folk singer, but she's always had a rock and roll heart as she shows most particularly on &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; (recently remade to excellent effect by The Counting Crows), the tropical paradise evoking &quot;Carey&quot; and the sweet love song &quot;Help Me&quot; that was one of her biggest hits. On the folkier side of things, there is the standard &quot;Both Sides Now,&quot; which for my money is more tuneful and superior to Judy Collins's hit version of the song. &quot;Woodstock&quot; is a postcard from another era, while the childhood memory-evoking &quot;The Circle Game&quot; is as poigniant as it is sweet. The collection gets a bonus star for including Mitchell's 1991 &quot;comeback&quot; tune &quot;Come in from the Cold,&quot; which evokes the strain of being a flower child at heart growing up in the McCarthy-ite 1950s. The CD booklet is also excellent, containing a full lyrics sheet.\n\nTrack Listings  \n\n[01] Urge For Going\n[02] Chelsea Morning\n[03] Big Yellow Taxi\n[04] Woodstock\n[05] The Circle Game\n[06] Carey\n[07] California\n[08] You Turn Me On I'm A Radio\n[09] Raised On Robbery\n[10] Help Me\n[11] Free Man In Paris\n[12] River\n[13] Chinese Cafe - Unchained Melody\n[14] Come In From The Cold\n[15] Both Sides Now\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h:00m:35s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 374mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta - FLAC\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Folk Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 29 October 1996\nRecord Company\t&gt; Reprise Records Time Warner\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://jonimitchell.com\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f40472ccfeeedb25b8eb27b7a10d0426e1bb99cf","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+Hits+-+Joni+Mitchell+374mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f40472ccfeeedb25b8eb27b7a10d0426e1bb99cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,4,114,204,254,238,219,37,184,235,39,183,161,13,4,38,225,187,153,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
