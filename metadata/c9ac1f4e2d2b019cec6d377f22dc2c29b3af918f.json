He lives above Scene Of The Crime, an art gallery specializing in photos of crime scenes that were taken by his uncle Knut. Paul Raymonds, a SFPD detective sergeant and old partner of JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, tells Jack heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sending a special client over in the morning. The relationship between Jack and Raymonds is strained, partly because Raymonds is cheating on JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aunt. The next morning, Jack meets Alex Jordan, a woman he figures out is RaymondsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lates girlfriend. Alex says her sister Maggie has vanished, and that she might be at a hippie commune called Lunarhouse. Once inside Lunarhouse, Jack finds himself up to his eyeballs in trouble. Maggie was there but is gone now, and some of the communeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big bouncers chase Jack from the scene. In no time at all, JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest takes him through the dark alleys of the city, the bleak fall-out from emotional pain and suffering of a family, and force his own black rage and weakness to the surface so he has to finally deal with those things. Secrets are everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â€œeven Jack has them.\n\nBY ED BRUBAKER,MICHAEL LARK AND SEAN PHILLIPS\n\nPUBLISHED BY DC,VERTIGO IMPRINT\n\nENJOY AND SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9ac1f4e2d2b019cec6d377f22dc2c29b3af918f","amp;dn":"SCENE+OF+THE+CRIME-A+LITTLE+PIECE+OF+GOODNIGHT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9ac1f4e2d2b019cec6d377f22dc2c29b3af918f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,172,31,78,45,43,1,156,236,109,55,127,34,220,44,41,179,175,145,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
