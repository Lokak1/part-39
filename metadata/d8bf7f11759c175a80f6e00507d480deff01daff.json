Each .MP3 is about an hour long... plus or minus a minute or two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8bf7f11759c175a80f6e00507d480deff01daff","amp;dn":"%26lt%3Bi%26gt%3BThe+Alex+Jones+Show%26lt%3B%2Fi%26gt%3B+--+2013+Apr+15+MO+%5Bextend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8bf7f11759c175a80f6e00507d480deff01daff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,191,127,17,117,156,23,90,128,246,224,5,7,212,128,222,255,1,218,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
