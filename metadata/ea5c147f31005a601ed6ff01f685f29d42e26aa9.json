Combining non-linear gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and are given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5c147f31005a601ed6ff01f685f29d42e26aa9","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto%3A+Vice+City+%5BIOS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5c147f31005a601ed6ff01f685f29d42e26aa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,92,20,127,49,0,90,96,30,214,255,1,246,133,242,157,66,226,106,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
