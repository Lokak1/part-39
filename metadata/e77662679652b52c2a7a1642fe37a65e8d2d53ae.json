Photo editing has never been so quick, easy and convenient.\n\nYou recently got married on a beautiful Caribbean beach. Everything was so perfect. Luckily, you have a lot of memorable snapshots of the crystalline water and white sand backdrop of the ceremony, you and your new spouse silhouetted in the sunset, your guests under a palm tree, that nude sunbather that somehow got included in a shot taken during the exchanging of vows. Yikes! Before showing your mom those photos, take a minute to remove that accidental guest from an otherwise great picture. Open your TouchRetouch app. Using your finger, select the Brush or Lasso tool to mark what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want in the shot, then hit the Ã¢â‚¬ËœGoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ button. Okay, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re done and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now safe to share your picture-perfect memories with everybody.\n\nTouchRetouch isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just for exotic or wedding photo touch-ups, of course.

All without distorting the final image.\n\nYou can even have a little fun with TouchRetouch. Take away the bicycle from under your brother and it looks like heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cycling in mid-air. You can make it look like people are flying, jumping or posed oddly, by removing whatever was supporting them.\nDo everything mentioned here and more, in mere seconds without any special equipment.\n\nFeatures:\nIn-app video tutorials\nUnlimited Undo/Redo actions\nSmart image background recovery techniques\nNo distortions in final image\nEasy to use interface\n1:1 view\nFinger move hint\nDownload TouchRetouch now and start creating amazing or funny photos.
