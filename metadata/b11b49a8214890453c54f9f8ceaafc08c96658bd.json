After going through a series of singers which included Courtney Love, the band was joined by Chuck Mosley in 1983. The same year, Jim Martin was recruited to replace guitarist Mark Bowen. The band is best known for combining elements of heavy metal, funk, progressive rock, hip hop, hardcore punk, thrash metal, and jazz and easy listening, among many others,[4] and have been hailed as an influential rock band.[3][5]\n\nFaith No More underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, We Care a Lot, in 1985. Within a year the band signed up with Slash Records, and in 1987 their second album Introduce Yourself was released. Membership remained stable until vocalist Chuck Mosley was replaced by Mike Patton in 1988. In 1989, the band released their highly successful album, The Real Thing, which featured their breakthrough hit single &quot;Epic&quot;. The band's next album, 1992's Angel Dust, was also highly successful and spawned the hit &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;, which became their sole #1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in their career. Faith No More however declined in popularity in the subsequent years. Longtime guitarist Jim Martin left the group in 1994 and was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. After the release of their next album, 1995's King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime, Spruance was replaced briefly by Dean Menta, who would eventually be replaced by their current guitarist Jon Hudson. After releasing one more album, Album of the Year, in 1997, Faith No More broke up in April 1998, and all members began work on side projects.\n\nOn February 24, 2009, Faith No More announced that they would be reforming for a European tour with the same lineup before their break up.[6] In June 2009, they performed together for the first time in eleven years at the Brixton Academy in London, England, as part of their The Second Coming Tour. As of 2010, the band has continued to perform at multiple live venues. \n\n\n\n\n\nFaith. No Man.  1982\n\n\n&quot;Quiet in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Song of Liberty&quot; are two songs released together as a double single and is the only official release by Faith No Man (stylised as Faith. No Man.), before the majority of their members quit and formed Faith No More. The single has been long out of print, making it very difficult to find.[1] The artwork, which was credited to Mike Morris; amongst other things, features an edited picture of Hitler wearing a tutu on the A-side of the disc[2] and a track listing on the B-side with a pale grey slipcase.\n\n\nThe songs were recorded in Matt Wallace's parent's garage, were Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio, while the band was still under the name of 'Sharp Young Men'[2] with Mike Morris, William Gould, Mike Bordin and Wade Worthington, who left shortly after. They changed their name to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace's garage, and hired Roddy Bottum to replace Wade. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More without any constant guitarists or vocalists until they eventually settled on Chuck Mosley and Jim Martin,\n\n\nAllmusic gave the release a rating of 3 out of 5 stars (     ) describing Mike Morris's vocals as &quot;actually really good&quot; and calls the lyrical content &quot;typical angry San Francisco punk topics: they hate the government, they hate their girlfriends, and they're terribly unsatisfied.&quot; Allmusic also credited it as sounding better than their official dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©but, We Care a Lot, and being a &quot;solid post-pun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11b49a8214890453c54f9f8ceaafc08c96658bd","amp;dn":"Faith+No+More+-+Studio+Discography+1982+-+1998+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11b49a8214890453c54f9f8ceaafc08c96658bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,27,73,168,33,72,144,69,60,84,249,248,206,170,252,8,201,102,88,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
