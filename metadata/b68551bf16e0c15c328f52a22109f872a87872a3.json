Director Alanis Obomsawin endured 78 nerve-wracking days and nights filming the armed stand-off between the Mohawks, the QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bec police and the Canadian army. A powerful feature-documentary emerges that takes you right into the action of an age-old aboriginal struggle. The result is a portrait of the people behind the barricades, providing insight into the Mohawks' unyelding determination to protect their land.&quot;\n\nTrailer:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68551bf16e0c15c328f52a22109f872a87872a3","amp;dn":"Kanehsatake+-+270+years+of+Resistance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68551bf16e0c15c328f52a22109f872a87872a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,133,81,191,22,224,193,92,50,143,82,162,33,9,248,114,168,120,114,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
