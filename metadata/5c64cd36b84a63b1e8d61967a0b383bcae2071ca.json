Ward\n\nBlackmail. Sex. Ferro.\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that Bryan Ferro is serious--if I don't sleep with him, he'll destroy me. Everything I've earned will be blown away like dust, and my life will no longer be my own. His demand for just one night rolls into days. He doesn't want me for a one-time fling, it's more than that.\n\nBut as I stand there, ready to tell him off, I hear it. The familiar sound, the hesitation, the slight hitch in his voice, and that's what forces me to my knees. It's not Neil, Maggie, or even the money--it's Bryan.\n\nGenre: New Adult Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c64cd36b84a63b1e8d61967a0b383bcae2071ca","amp;dn":"The+Proposition+2+-+H.M.+Ward+%28Mobi+format+for+Kindle%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c64cd36b84a63b1e8d61967a0b383bcae2071ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,100,205,54,184,74,99,177,232,214,25,103,160,179,131,188,174,32,113,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
