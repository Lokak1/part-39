His mellow, resonant voice, subtle vocal style and notably clean intonation marked him out, along with a liking for long, seemingly endless musical phrases. When Mohamed Abdel Wahhaab switched from singing to composition, he pretty much stepped into his shoes. Born in 1929, Abdel Halim studied at Cairo&amp;#039;s Institute of Arabic Music and the Higher Institute for Theatre Music, and began his career teaching and playing oboe before taking aim at vocal stardom. His first hit came in 1951, and he soon signed a contract with Abdel Wahhaab to sing his songs and appear in his films. During the 1960s, he started to sing colloquial poetry more colorful and meaningful and nearer to popular folk song than ordinary pop songs, and his work on these lines had a significant influence on popular song in general. He cofounded a film company and the Saut el-Fann record label in the early &amp;#039;60s, and remained a major star until he died in 1977 of Bilharzia, which he had caught as a child and which had begun to affect him intermittently from 1955 onward. ~ John Storm Roberts, All Music Guide\n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b285dafb07f30028b0858bf11302f3f41b6970","amp;dn":"Abdel+Halim+Hafiz++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b285dafb07f30028b0858bf11302f3f41b6970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,178,133,218,251,7,243,0,40,176,133,139,241,19,2,243,244,27,105,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
