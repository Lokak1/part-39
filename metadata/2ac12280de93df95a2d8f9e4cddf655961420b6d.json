Translated by Samuel Butler.\n\n\n\n__________\nLINKS\n\nText-Source\t: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1727\nWikipedia\t: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey\n\n\n__________\nSUMMARY\n\nThe Odyssey is one of the two major ancient Greek epic poems (the\nother being the Iliad), attributed to the poet Homer. The poem is\ncommonly dated to between 800 and 600 BC. The poem is, in part, a\nsequel to the Iliad, and concerns the events that befall the Greek\nhero Odysseus in his long journey back to his native land Ithaca after\nthe fall of Troy.\n\nIt takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca\nafter ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus\nand his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who\nhave moved into Odysseus? home to compete for Penelope&amp;#039;s hand in\nmarriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.  \n\nThe poem is a fundamental text in the Western canon and continues to\nbe read in both Homeric Greek and translations around the world.\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n__________\nCHAPTERS\n\nBook 01 - 00:23:06 \nRead by: Kirsten Ferreri\n\nBook 02 - 00:23:22 \nRead by: Kirsten Ferreri\n\nBook 03 - 00:25:20 \nRead by: Kirsten Ferreri\n\nBook 04 - 00:30:48 \nRead by: Kirsten Ferreri\n\nBook 05 - 00:27:53 \nRead by: JemmaBlythe\n\nBook 06 - 00:22:53 \nRead by: Gesine\n\nBook 07 - 00:19:09 \nRead by: Hugh McGuire\n\nBook 08 - 00:18:40 \nRead by: ontheroad\n\nBook 09 - 00:38:23 \nRead by: Reynard T.
