So who does he pick? George Jetson. So George packs up his family: Jane, his sensible and loving wife; Judy- his rebellious teenage daughter who's gotten a new boyfriend: a super galactical rock star; Elroy- basketball champ who's losing faith in his father; and Rosie, his sassy maid. So while Judy meets another boy and enjoys a huge shopping mall, George sets off to work with his new friend, a robot foreman named Rudy 2. The factory is soon sabotaged on opening day, so George intends to investigate and disappears. So it's up to Elroy and his new friends to rescue George. Along for the ride are Judy and Jane.\n\nA wild futuristic romp on a screen bigger than your TV.\n\nGeneral : C:\\Users\\winker\\Desktop\\JETSONS THE MOVIE-1990 IN XVID MULTI AUDIO BY WINKER\\jetsons.avi\nFormat : AVI at 1 626 Kbps\nLength : 915 MiB for 1h 18mn 41s 600ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 949 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 552 (1.855) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nAudio #1 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nAudio #2 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nAudio #3 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05064c7365fcb84491e9820b9bdc922e85c6be69","amp;dn":"JETSONS+THE+MOVIE-1990+IN+XVID+MULTI+AUDIO+BY+WINKER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05064c7365fcb84491e9820b9bdc922e85c6be69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,6,76,115,101,252,184,68,145,233,130,11,155,220,146,46,133,198,190,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
