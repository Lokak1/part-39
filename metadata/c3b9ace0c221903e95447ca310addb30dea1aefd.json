Are you experiencing temperatures greatly lower than normal? You could have polar vortex. Ask your meteorologist. The polar vortex may actually be caused by climate change in a complex chain involving the melting of the Arctic icecaps. That will be impossible for Republicans to graspÃ¢â‚¬â€they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even understand that global warming causes warming.\n\nToday Senate Republicans failed in an attempt to filibuster extending unemployment insurance benefits. Meanwhile, Fox News is saying that unemployment insurance is immoral! Fox contributor Steve Hayes said Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to make a moral argument against extended unemployment insurance forever.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ OK Steve, feel free to bring that up if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bill that gives anyone unemployment benefits forever. The bill weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about just does it for three months.\n\nTomorrow is the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson launching the War on Poverty. Republicans are taking the opportunity to ramp up their War on the Poor. Republicans will tell you that they want to end the War of Poverty because it has failed to end poverty. But the real reason they want to end it is because it has succeeded in reducing poverty.\n\nOn CNN, Dennis Rodman became loud and belligerent after being asked about Kenneth Bae, an American citizen who has been imprisoned by North Korea. Dennis, the network for crazy yelling is Fox News.\n\nFinally, Ben Sasse, an extremist Republican Senate candidate from Nebraska is suggesting that we move the U.S. Capitol to Nebraska. Maybe that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the best idea to launch at a time when the wind chill in Nebraska is 40 degrees below zero. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s move the Capitol to Nebraska! Great, our members of Congress spend so little time at work alreadyÃ¢â‚¬â€how much less time would they spend at work if their job was in Nebraska?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b9ace0c221903e95447ca310addb30dea1aefd","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+January+07+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b9ace0c221903e95447ca310addb30dea1aefd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,185,172,224,194,33,144,62,149,68,124,163,16,173,219,48,222,161,174,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
