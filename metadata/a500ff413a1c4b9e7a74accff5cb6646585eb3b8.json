Feature film productions, multi-million dollar game productions, huge and small architectual visualizations have trusted their visuals to V-Ray. Wouldn't you too?\nV-Ray has become a benchmark for speed used by many hardware vendors and other renderer developers to test against. Richest set of features, cost-effective and production-ready\n\n\nI. Architecture\n(*) Object-oriented API\n(*) Fully multithreaded\n(*) Unified quasi-Monte Carlo sampling system\n(*) Distributed rendering\n(*) Efficient shading system specifically optimized for ray-tracing \tII. Geometry\n(*) Efficient geometry handling\n(*) On-demand geometry creation\n(*) On-demand geometry loading from disk files\n(*) Displacement mapping\n(*) Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision surfaces\n(*) Extensible with custom geometric primitives through the V-Ray SDK\n\nIII. Image sampling\n(*) Different sampling methods.\n(*) Full-scene antialiasing.\n(*) Progressive path tracing.\n(*) Support for additional render elements (diffuse, reflection, GI etc). \tIV. Illumination\n(*) Physically accurate full global illumination solutions\n(*) Different GI algorithms: path tracing, irradiance cache, photon maps, light cache.\n(*) Reusable GI solutins for accelerated rendering of walk-through animations.\n(*) Physically accurate area lights.\n(*) Extensible with custom lights through the V-Ray SDK.\n\nV. Shaders\n(*) Advanced material\n(*) Blurry reflections/refractions\n(*) Accurate hilights\n(*) Sub-surface scattering\n(*) Extensible with custom shaders through the V-Ray SDK \tVI. Camera effects\n(*) Depth-of-field with bokeh effects\n(*) Accurate motion blur\n(*) Extensible with custom cameras through the V-Ray SDK\n\nVII. Extras\n(*) Toon effect\n(*) Fur generator\n(*) Extended matte/shadow capabilities\n(*) Support for Render-to-Texture mode of 3dsmax \tVIII. Frame buffer\n(*) V-Ray specific frame buffer with integrated color corrections and display of multiple rendering elements.\n(*) Direct rendering to disk for extremely large images. Rendered images can be converted to OpenEXR files or imported back into 3dsmax.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a500ff413a1c4b9e7a74accff5cb6646585eb3b8","amp;dn":"Vray+Render1.5+R3+-+Tutorials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a500ff413a1c4b9e7a74accff5cb6646585eb3b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,0,255,65,58,28,75,158,122,116,172,207,245,203,102,70,88,94,179,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
