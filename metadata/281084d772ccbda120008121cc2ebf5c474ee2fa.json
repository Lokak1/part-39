It allows to rescue lost files from a bad or trashed CD or DVD or a Blu Ray disc (e.g. BD or HD DVD) ! Save important documents, precious pictures or video from the family, your only system backup, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦IsoBuster can do it all! IsoBuster is a highly specialized yet easy to use optical media data recovery tool. It supports all optical disc formats and all common optical disc file-systems. Start up IsoBuster, Insert a disc, select the drive (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media. IsoBuster immediately shows you all the tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file-systems that are present. This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file-system. Instead of being limited to one file-system that the OS picks for you, you have access to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the complete pictureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Access data from older sessions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.\n\nCombine this all-revealing functionality with far better read and recovery mechanisms, scanning for lost files functionality, workarounds for a wide range of drive and software bugs, limitations or shortcomings and you have an enormously powerful data recovery tool. IsoBuster is must-have-software for every PC user and is deliberately kept low priced to be able to offer a solution for everybody.\n\nIsobuster interprets CD image files, such as:\n *.DAO (Duplicator), *.TAO (Duplicator), *.ISO (Nero, BlindRead, Creator), *.BIN (CDRWin), *.IMG (CloneCD), *.CCD (CloneCD) , *.CIF (Creator), *.FCD (Uncompressed), *.NRG (Nero), *.GCD (Prassi), *.P01 (Toast), *.C2D (WinOnCD), *.CUE (CDRWin), *.CDI (DiscJuggler), *.CD (CD-i OptImage), *.GI (Prassi PrimoDVD), *.PXI (PlexTools), *.MDS (Alcohol), *.MDF (Alcohol), *.VC4 (Virtual CD), *.000 (Virtual CD), *.B5T (BlindWrite), *.B5I (BlindWrite), *.DMG (Apple Macintosh), *.IBP (IsoBuster), *.IBQ (IsoBuster), *.NCD (NTI).\n\n\nOS: Windows 2000 SP 4, Windows 2003, Windows XP, Windows VISTA, Windows 7 and 8 \nHome Page: www.smart-projects.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:281084d772ccbda120008121cc2ebf5c474ee2fa","amp;dn":"IsoBuster+Pro+3.1+Build+3.1.0.0+Final","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"281084d772ccbda120008121cc2ebf5c474ee2fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,16,132,215,114,204,189,161,32,0,129,33,204,46,191,92,71,78,226,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
