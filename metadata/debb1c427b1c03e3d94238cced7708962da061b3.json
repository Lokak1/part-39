Each singer took on a separate and distinct persona, portraying different characters in an attempt to show the Confederacy and the concept of &quot;Southern pride&quot; through said characters' eyes; in essence, therefore, White Mansions is a concept album. Eric Clapton played the guitar on several tracks. The record was a rather unsuccessful endeavor and went by relatively unnoticed, never charting.\n\n  01. Story To Tell - Jessie Colter\n  02.
