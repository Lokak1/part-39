Thus we have such tunes as &quot;Draft Resister,&quot; &quot;America,&quot; and &quot;Fag.&quot; The title track was a hit in an edited version while &quot;Power Play&quot; became a staple of their concerts. This was the last studio album put together by the original five members. Better than average. ~ James Chrispell, All Music Guide \n\n[img]http://bayimg.com/jAECKAACO[/img] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgkk.com/t/HMAWSP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgkk.com/t/HMAWSP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a829de64a2646134e4936bd25a2317311d3372","amp;dn":"Steppenwolf+Monster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a829de64a2646134e4936bd25a2317311d3372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,168,41,222,100,162,100,97,52,228,147,107,210,90,35,23,49,29,51,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
