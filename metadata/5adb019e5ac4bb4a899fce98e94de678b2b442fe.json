It is not the (JP) version patched with English text that I upped before.\n\nIf you were playing the JP version patched with English text your SAV file is compatible.\n\nI am including my SAV file as well, it has all 16 badges and Red downed.  You can use my SAV to give you hints and such on where to go or something.\n\n\nTested on TTDS 1.17a12 firmware.\n\nIf you have an Acekard or Cyclo DS then DO NOT GET THIS as those cards support the game NON Patched.\n\nThe patch applied was from here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=217811&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=217811&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to patch yourself or follow updates.  It appears to be working fine.\n\n-PT\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5adb019e5ac4bb4a899fce98e94de678b2b442fe","amp;dn":"Pokemon+HeartGold+%28U%29+%28AP+defeated+V2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5adb019e5ac4bb4a899fce98e94de678b2b442fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,219,1,158,90,196,187,74,137,159,206,152,233,77,230,120,178,180,66,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
