But after he was injured while apprehending an addict, signs of Mike's obsessive-compulsive disorder started to emerge. His fear of germs caused him to wash his hands over 40 times a day. The problem forced him to retire early, and his wife divorced him. He was able to keep his OCD under control for eight years, but a relapse caused him to think his food was spoiled, and almost starve. Mike's children feel an intervention is their only hope of helping him. Jenny, 32, is a talented hairstylist from a close-knit Mormon family. When a diagnosis of endometriosis crushes her dreams of having a family, she turns to prescription drugs. Her addiction quickly escalates to IV heroin and meth use. With Jenny on the verge of her next overdose, can her family stop enabling her drug use and get her the help she needs?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f53ad490db1dd950b7acd71f202e58884a3d47e","amp;dn":"Intervention+S04E20+Mike+and+Jenny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f53ad490db1dd950b7acd71f202e58884a3d47e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,83,173,73,13,177,221,149,11,122,205,113,242,2,229,136,132,163,212,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
