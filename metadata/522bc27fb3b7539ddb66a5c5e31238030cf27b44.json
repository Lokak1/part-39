The Lost Symbol is a masterstroke of storytelling--a deadly race through a real-world labyrinth of codes, secrets, and unseen truths . . . all under the watchful eye of BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most terrifying villain to date. Set within the hidden chambers, tunnels, and temples of Washington, D.C., The Lost Symbol accelerates through a startling landscape toward an unthinkable finale.\n\nAs the story opens, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned unexpectedly to deliver an evening lecture in the U.S. Capitol Building. Within minutes of his arrival, however, the night takes a bizarre turn. A disturbing object--artfully encoded with five symbols--is discovered in the Capitol Building. Langdon recognizes the object as an ancient invitation . . . one meant to usher its recipient into a long-lost world of esoteric wisdom.\n\nWhen LangdonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved mentor, Peter Solomon--a prominent Mason and philanthropist--is brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and follow wherever it leads him. Langdon is instantly plunged into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and never-before-seen locations--all of which seem to be dragging him toward a single, inconceivable truth.\n\n\n                          Formats - Epub and Mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:522bc27fb3b7539ddb66a5c5e31238030cf27b44","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Symbol+by+Dan+Brown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"522bc27fb3b7539ddb66a5c5e31238030cf27b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,43,194,127,179,183,83,157,219,102,165,197,227,18,56,3,12,242,123,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
