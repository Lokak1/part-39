The original members of the group were Bob James (keyboards), Lee Ritenour (guitars), Nathan East (bass), and Harvey Mason (drums). In 1997, Lee Ritenour left the group and Fourplay chose Larry Carlton as his replacement. In 2010, Larry Carlton left Fourplay and was replaced by Chuck Loeb. Grammy-nominated supergroup Fourplay has enjoyed consistent artistic and commercial success by grafting elements of R&amp;B and pop to their unwavering jazz foundations. In a span of twenty years and eleven albums, the quartet has continued to explore the limitless dimensions and permutations of jazz while at the same time appealing to a broad mainstream audience. Their first record, 1991's Fourplay, sold over a million copies and remained at the number one position on Billboard's contemporary jazz chart for 33 weeks. Their next LP, 1993's Between the Sheets, reached number one, went gold, and received a Grammy nomination. In 1994, their third gold album, Elixir, also reached the number one position and remained on the chart for more than 90 weeks.\n\nAlbums List:\n\nDISCOGRAPHY ::: STUDIJNYE Albums\nOriginal Composition: Bob James - Keyboards; Lee Ritenour - Guitars; Nathan East - Bass, Vocals; Harvey Mason, Sr.. - Drums\nFourplay - 1991 - Fourplay\nFourplay - 1993 - Between the Sheets\nFourplay - 1995 - Elixir\nFourplay - 1997 - The Best of Fourplay (+4 new tracks)\n\nAmendments Staff: - Lee Ritenour / Larry Carlton + - Guitar\nFourplay - 1998 - Fourplay 4\nFourplay - 1999 - Snowbound\nFourplay - 2000 - Yes, Please!\nFourplay - 2002 - Heartfelt\nFourplay - 2004 - Journey\nFourplay - 2006 - Fourplay X\nFourplay - 2008 - Energy\n\nAmendments Staff: - Larry Carlton / + Chuck Loeb - Guitar\nFourplay - 2010 - Let's Touch the Sky\nFourplay - 2012 - Esprit de Four\n\nLIVE ALBUMS ::: Concerts\n\nFourplay - 1994 - An Evening of Fourplay Vol.I (DVD5)\nFourplay - 1994 - An Evening of Fourplay Vol.II (DVD5)\nFourplay - 2006 - Live at San Javier Jazz Festival (Source Unnown)\nFourplay - 2008 - Tokyo Jazz Festival 2008 (DVD5) ::: CBR.256 kbps\nFourplay - 2009 - Live in Capetown (DVD5)\n\n====\nTracklist\n====\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\nMembers: Bob James - Keyboards; Lee Ritenour - Guitars; Nathan East - Bass, Vocals; Harvey Mason, Sr. - Drums\n\nFourplay - 1991 - Fourplay\nOriginal Release: 1991 Warner Bros.
