Injecting venom into samples of his blood, Australia's Bryan Fry demonstrates how the world's deadliest snake, the inland taipan, has converted the building blocks of its body into lethal toxins.\n\n Meanwhile, Toto Olivera will introduce us to the cone snail, pound-for-pound the most toxic creature in the world, able to continually update their chemical cocktails with the help of the world's fastest-evolving genes, guaranteeing they stay one step ahead of their prey.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducers:  Kurt Tondorf &amp; Kate Walker\n--------------------------------------\n\nNarrator:  Gareth Armstrong\n---------------------------\n\n\nTitle: Evolve-Venom\nYear:  2008\nFile Size: 349 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:44:05\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 640x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1083 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 123 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1283572/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1283572/&lt;/a&gt;  \n \n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:  Ok people we are back to normal.All images can be seen as usual\n-------------\n             \n \n              \n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd16ad60a67971b493d1c47e7f80f93ccb844649","amp;dn":"Evolve-Venom-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd16ad60a67971b493d1c47e7f80f93ccb844649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,22,173,96,166,121,113,180,147,209,196,126,127,128,249,60,203,132,70,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
