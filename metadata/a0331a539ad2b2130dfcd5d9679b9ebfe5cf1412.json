One thing that can be said about them is that they make everything their own-- even though this was recorded over a span of eight years, there&amp;#039;s a remarkable sense of consistency to the sound and the music, with everything being assimulateed into the Chili Peppers&amp;#039; funk/punk sound-- Dylan&amp;#039;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; sits comfortably next to Stevie Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;Higher Ground&quot;. There&amp;#039;s a remarkably high level of consistency. But more importantly, it&amp;#039;s still really quite listenable. \n\n1. They&amp;#039;re Red Hot \n2. Fire \n3.

Other highlights here, including 1990&amp;#039;s &quot;Show Me Your Soul&quot; (which proves the band learned plenty from working with George Clinton on 1985&amp;#039;s Freaky Styley), their superb cover of Stevie Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;Higher Ground,&quot; and the feel-good funk of &quot;Behind the Sun,&quot; show the Peppers paved the way for a school of alt bands who melded funk with rock riffs. There are plenty other less-celebrated moments from the Peppers&amp;#039; early days that shine on their own, and only a few self-indulgent clunkers (what drove them to such a dismal performance of Jimi Hendrix&amp;#039;s &quot;Fire&quot;?). This collection will suffice for the casual fan who needs a quick intro to the Peppers&amp;#039; history.\n\n1. Higher Ground \n2. Fight like A Brave \n3. Behind The Sun \n4. Me &amp; My Friends \n5.

Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother&amp;#039;s Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band&amp;#039;s guitarist. Frusciante&amp;#039;s return was credited with changing the band&amp;#039;s sound altogether. The record was a notable shift in style from what was produced with Navarro. The album&amp;#039;s subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, and introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.\n\n\nAll songs written by Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\n1. &quot;Around the World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n2. &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n3. &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n4. &quot;Otherside&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n5. &quot;Get on Top&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n6. &quot;Californication&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n7. &quot;Easily&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n8. &quot;Porcelain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n9. &quot;Emit Remmus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n10. &quot;I Like Dirt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n11. &quot;This Velvet Glove&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n12. &quot;Savior&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n13. &quot;Purple Stain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n14. &quot;Right on Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52\n15. &quot;Road Trippin&amp;#039;&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n\n\n\n\nI think thats all of them,If it isnt maybe you can load the missing parts\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0331a539ad2b2130dfcd5d9679b9ebfe5cf1412","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+Discography+Start","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0331a539ad2b2130dfcd5d9679b9ebfe5cf1412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,51,26,83,154,210,178,19,13,252,213,217,103,155,158,191,229,207,20,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
