They are, of course, terribly dated by now, but that only adds to the fun and the nostalgia. They also do a pretty good job of explaining the facts as they were known back then. For example, the film UNCHAINED GODDESS (dealing with weather) does a better job of explaining the Coriolis effect than any explanation I was given in college level physics classes. I would further guess that  the success and proliferation of this series of cartoons (and certain others not listed here) at this time was largely prompted by an American Culture that nearly panicked in 1957 when the Soviets launched the first satellite, Sputnik. The very next year, loads of emergency ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“catch-upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ legislation came out of Congress, especially the creation of NASA and the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which provided a first rate science facility to every secondary school in America, no matter how rural.\n\nSo, for those of you 35 and older, sit back and watch a little nostalgic fun from 6th grade. For those younger, you may want to preview this before showing it to your kids ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the info and the technique are quite dated. At this point, these films are really more history (this is how they taught science when Grandma was a girl) than science. The films have no subtitles, so no .srt files.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Laboratory_Science_Series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Laboratory_Science_Series&lt;/a&gt;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Bell Laboratory Science Series was a series of educational films made for Bell Labs by Frank Capra, Walt Disney, and others.
