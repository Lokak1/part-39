No efforts were made to improve the sound. Poor cover design.\n  \n  Concert:   The show is typical for this Vegas gig. Elvis isn`t very talkative. The first time he really speaks to the audience is when he starts the intros. This lack of interaction with the audience makes this show somewhat boring although the songs are performed with great passion. (Ciscoking) \n\n\nWith covers! Enjoy!
