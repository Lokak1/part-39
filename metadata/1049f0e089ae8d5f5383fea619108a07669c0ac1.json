We have Salina, a full-time nanny and absolute stunner with an eating disorder. Her bulimia causes her to binge eat; her job forces her to hide her purging via trash bags. Literally, trash bags of vomit. And Troy, oh Troy! He's addicted to sex and methamphetamine. Between anonymous encounters, typically unprotected, and crystal meth, he doesn't seem to have time for much else. Afraid to learn his HIV status, he uses meth, in part, to feel less guilt about the amount of unprotected sex he engages in - a guilt exacerbated by the fact that he may be spreading a deadly disease. Salina &amp; Troy form quite a pair in Intervention, Season 2, Episode 5.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1049f0e089ae8d5f5383fea619108a07669c0ac1","amp;dn":"Intervention+S02E05+-+Salina+and+Troy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1049f0e089ae8d5f5383fea619108a07669c0ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,73,240,224,137,174,141,95,83,131,254,166,25,16,138,7,102,156,10,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
