Influenced early in life by circus and vaudeville performers who passed through his family's hotel in Nashville, Dave was exposed to many styles of performance and in 1885 he met banjo player Joel Davidson and became captivated by the instrument.  By the 1890s, Dave was entertaining stagecoach passengers with banjo tunes and comic antics from a homemade stage on the roof of the family's barn. \n\nUncle Dave Macon was one of the first country stars to record, the first star of the Grand Ole Opry, and one of the first members elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nPossibly one of the finest sets out.  If you want to really understand the depth of early country music, then you must have this set.  Macon had all the styles and showmanship that influenced everyone from Charlie Poole to Bill Monroe.  Every single song that was ever issued by Macon is contained on this set and the book is an incredible read. Most recommended! ~ Ben Dewberry\n\nThis is the best box set for the hardcore Uncle Dave Macon fan.  If you want to hear live tracks you have never had access to, and if you want to find out what the older tracks that were only released on 78 rpm are all about, you need this box!  The book is wonderful with newly found photos and a very detailed discography of the recordings! Probably, a little too rich for the casual fan. ~ M. Bailey\n\nPlease see for more information - Schon55 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUncle Dave Macon - Keep My Skillet Good &amp; Greasy CD 5 of 6\n01  Molly Married A Travelling Man\n02  When Reuben Comes To Town\n03  Got No Silver Nor Gold Blues\n04  Heartaching Blues\n05  Roe Rire Poor Gal\n06  You've Been A Friend To Me\n07  Blackwater Blues\n08  More Like Your Dad Every Day\n09  I'll Never Go There Any More (The Bowery)\n10  Jesus, Lover Of My Soul\n11  From Earth To Heaven\n12  The Coon That Had The Razor\n13  Buddy Won't You Roll Down The Line\n14  Worthy Of Estimation\n15  I'm The Child To Fight\n16  Over The Road I'm Bound To Go\n17  The New Ford Car\n18  The Gal That Got Stuck On Everything She Said\n19  Comin' Round The Mountain\n20  Governor Al Smith\n21  Darling Zelma Lee\n22  Put Me In The Little Bed\n23  Life And Death Of Jesse James\n24  Man That Rode The Mule Around The World\n25  Tennessee Jubilee\n26  New Coon In Town","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b157402f7b8188c9a9ca1a270d39a18f81eaa9ef","amp;dn":"Uncle+Dave+Macon+-+Keep+My+Skillet+Good+%26+Greasy+CD+5+of+6+%281979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b157402f7b8188c9a9ca1a270d39a18f81eaa9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,87,64,47,123,129,136,201,169,202,26,39,13,57,161,143,129,234,169,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
