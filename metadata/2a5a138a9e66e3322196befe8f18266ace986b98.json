It comprises liquid waste discharged by domestic residences, commercial properties, industry, and/or agriculture and can encompass a wide range of potential contaminants and concentrations. In the most common usage, it refers to the municipal wastewater that contains a broad spectrum of contaminants resulting from the mixing of wastewaters from different sources. With the dwindling available water resources in the world coupled with high population growth, pressure is being exerted on water and wastewater plant managers the world over to find cost-effective methods to treat a wide range of wastewater pollutants in a diverse range of situations. This new and important book gathers the latest research from around the globe on fluid waste disposal with a focus on such topics as: wastewaters from the olive industry, application of sulphate-reducing bacteria in biological treatment wastewaters, electrocoagulation treatment method, usability of boron doped diamond electrodes in wastewater treatment and others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a5a138a9e66e3322196befe8f18266ace986b98","amp;dn":"Fluid+Waste+Disposal+%28Environmental+Science%2C+Engineering+and+Tec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a5a138a9e66e3322196befe8f18266ace986b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,90,19,138,158,102,227,50,33,150,190,254,143,24,38,106,206,152,107,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
