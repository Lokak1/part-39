There is alternative artwork at http://www.postmodern.com/~fi/pattipics/htm/askthe.htm but their back cover lacks side-flaps.\n\n1997\n01  Don&amp;#039;t Say Nothing  5:44\n02  Wing 7:17\n03  Beneath The Southern Cross  4:52\n04  About A Boy  7:18\n05  People Have The Power  5:24\n\n26 March 1978\n06  Ask The Angels  3:02\n07  25th Floor  5:49\n08  Pumping  3:49\n09  Till Victory  3:20\n10  Privilege  3:55\n11  Because The Night  3:37\n12  Gloria  6:59\n\nTime:  61:06\nSize:  382MB\n\n*Note*\nIncluding this version of excerpts of Patti&amp;#039;s 26 March 1978 show there are eight versions I know of, four of which I have including the pre-FM one running at http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=171832\n\nI did a comparison of the four versions I have.  (I&amp;#039;ve attached to a Comment a link containing a jpeg of these 4 versions; spectral analysis on the top, peaks on the bottom, the other pre-FM torrent on the left, the boots &quot;Ask The Angels&quot;, &quot;Live In Paris&quot;, and &quot;Exodus&quot; are 2nd, 3rd, and 4th from the left.)\n\nAs you can see from the line on the two to the right, they appear to be post-FM.  And the dimeadozen torrent and this &quot;Ask The Angels&quot; torrent appear to be pre-FM.\n\n&quot;Exodus&quot; has poor sound quality.  &quot;Live In Paris&quot; is better, but not good.  IMO this torrent of the boot &quot;Ask The Angels&quot; is a bit better, clearer than the other pre-FM torrent.  I think this torrent is superior, but it&amp;#039;s close, YMMV.\n\nHowever, this torrent does not contain the complete Paris show.  Someday someone might collect all the versions and create a complete &quot;best&quot; version.  I might possibly find time to do that one of these years.  Note that it wouldn&amp;#039;t be allowed at dimeadozen.org\n\nAbsolutely no selling!  Please share freely.  Please only convert to mp3 for your own use.  Please support the artists.\n\nmagicriver 12 January 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3acdc186429c02784fa484dda2e2e062b532308","amp;dn":"Patti+Smith+1978-03-26+%5C%27Ask+The+Angels%5C%27+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3acdc186429c02784fa484dda2e2e062b532308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,172,220,24,100,41,192,39,132,250,72,77,218,46,46,6,43,83,35,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
