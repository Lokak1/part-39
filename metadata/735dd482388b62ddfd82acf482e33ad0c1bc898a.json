Somehow the price got very inflated on amazon....  Please keep seading.  thnx.\n\n\nIn 1982, young American Samantha Smith worried about war and dreamed of peace. While the United States and the Soviet Union (Russia) were still locked in the grip of the Cold War, she wrote to the Soviet leader. His three-page reply and her response to his invitation to visit his country drew attention all over the world and became a significant part of the dramatic lowering of tensions between the two superpowers. \nIllustrated with many photographs, this is a new edition of the inspiring story written by a young American girl whose historic trip in 1983 helped to end the Cold War. Samantha and her father died in a plane crash in Maine only two years later, but her gift to peace in the world remains an inspiration to all who yearn to bring our world together.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735dd482388b62ddfd82acf482e33ad0c1bc898a","amp;dn":"Samantha+Smith+-+Journey+to+the+Soviet+Union","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735dd482388b62ddfd82acf482e33ad0c1bc898a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,93,212,130,56,139,98,221,253,130,172,244,130,227,58,208,193,188,137,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
