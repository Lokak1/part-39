It was recorded in December, 1978 at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, on an experimental 3M digital recorder.  The engineer in charge was Tom Jung, later of DMP Records. \n\n The digital master was transferred directly to vinyl without a mixdown and released in VERY small numbers.  There is a rumour (perhaps an urban legend) that the pressing moulds were damaged after just a few hundred discs were made and \nthe digital machine had since been dismantled, rendering the master tapes un-playable... not sure how true this is, though.\n\n The personnel on this album are the usual crew: Jimmy &quot;Flim&quot; Johnson; Billy Barber; Bill Berg; Dick Oatts is featured on \njust a couple of the cuts, most notably 'Maid Marian.'\n\nEnjoy.     -Dingo Jay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6d767f15bfd18b87edb5a57aae0f9b072e171a","amp;dn":"Flim+And+The+BBs+-+Self+Titled+%5B1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6d767f15bfd18b87edb5a57aae0f9b072e171a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,109,118,127,21,191,209,139,135,237,181,165,122,174,15,155,7,46,23,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
