Please seed to let the world know about the booming Chinese Rock scene.\n\n\n01 - Duck Fight Goose:\n\nDuck Fight Goose was formed in 2009. Members are Duck, Goose, Panda and Dragon.\nThey refuse all kinds of sadness and play funny games with their instruments. \nThey were influenced mainly by themselves. \nThey blended traditional-rock, experimental-rock and electronic music into a swinging and swagging yet psychedelic experience. \nThey are incredibly new.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://site.douban.com/duckfightgoose/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://site.douban.com/duckfightgoose/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n02 - X is Y:\n\nAn acute and provocative outfit occupying their own corner in ShanghaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live music scene, X is Y is a two-piece rock act that offers the confounding but variously cathartic rhythms and sonic structures of math rock delivered with an agenda to self-evisceration and public sacrifice. Since forming in 2010, the band has pushed their unorthodox and unflinchingly idiosyncratic design in venues large and small in Shanghai, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also frequently appeared on several stages in the greater China region. In transferring their powerful live act to disc on their latest recordings -- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never SeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“LPÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- X is Y have taken a self-consciously pious DIY approach, endeavoring to capture and convey the honest minutiae of recorded performance with the intensity of emotional surrender.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://site.douban.com/xisy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://site.douban.com/xisy/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n03 - Boys Climbing Ropes:\n\nBoys Climbing Ropes is a Rock, Post Punk artist in Shanghai, originally from Shanghai.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://site.douban.com/bcr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://site.douban.com/bcr/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n04 - Ã¥ËœÅ½Ã¨Â°Æ’ (The Gar):\n\nThe Gar, Beijing-based Garage-rock band\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/The_Gar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/The_Gar&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05 - Carsick Cars:\n\nCarsick Cars is a Rock, Indie Rock, Experimental Noise artist in Beijing, originally from Beijing.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://site.douban.com/carsickcars/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://site.douban.com/carsickcars/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n06 - PK14:\n\nThe abbreviated name P.K.14 is a continuous play on words.

A taut bass, a jagged guitar, a cold and urgent voice; the insistent nervous rhythm of a drum loop: the nocturnal heartbeat of a particular kind of person.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/Snapline&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/Snapline&lt;/a&gt;\n\n09 - Rainbow Danger Club:\n\nRainbow Danger Club is a Retro Rock, Indie, Rock, Art Rock artist in Shanghai, originally from Shanghai.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/Rainbow_Danger_Club&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/Rainbow_Danger_Club&lt;/a&gt;\n\n10 - Pairs:\n\nPairs, the Shanghai noise rock duo who utilize a 'thumbs up, vomit down' approach to writing music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://site.douban.com/pairs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://site.douban.com/pairs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n11 - Wang Wen:\n\nWang Wen is a Rock, Post Rock artist in Dalian, originally from Dalian. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/Wang_Wen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockinchina.com/w/Wang_Wen&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66bfb91b6b0b23cb1977d02fb81d2879075ee1cd","amp;dn":"Indie+Rock+-+China+-+11+Best+Bands","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66bfb91b6b0b23cb1977d02fb81d2879075ee1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,191,185,27,107,11,35,203,25,119,208,47,184,29,40,121,7,94,225,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
