They wear their influences and hearts on their sleeves on Sweet Nothings (Lonesome Day Records) and it wouldn't be a stretch to add the tracks from their latest disc to your Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, Marty Robbins, Dwight Yoakam, Chris Isaak party mixtape. Frontman Ward Hayden displays some impressive pipes as he croons and cracks his way through eleven tracks with a dose of Elvis swagger. Ward's songwriting deals with matters of the heart, heartbreak and hard livin' but avoids slipping into the drunk whiskey cliches that litter country music. If life was fair you'd hear these tracks on country radio (Hey, Dwight did it) but until that happens pick up a copy, make a mix tape, throw a party and wait for your friends to ask &quot;Who is that?!&quot;\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/27/girls-guns-and-glory/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/27/girls-guns-and-glory/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b35a0bc2d1a67c4dbbb47c9a86b515f5747356","amp;dn":"Girls+Guns+and+Glory...+Sweet+Nothings%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b35a0bc2d1a67c4dbbb47c9a86b515f5747356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,179,90,11,194,209,166,124,77,187,180,124,154,134,181,21,245,116,115,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
