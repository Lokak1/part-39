At the Carnivale, Samson's loss is Lodz's gain when the blind mystic takes Samson's place as the liaison to Management. Libby catches on to her mother's deception of her lustful fling with Jones, while Sofie accuses Apollonia of &quot;breaking the rules&quot; when she forces Sofie to tell the truth to their tarot clients about their bleak futures. Ben and Samson come up empty in search of information about Scudder's whereabouts when they visit one of Scudder's hangouts; a men's club called the Templars Club. Stumpy takes his lumps in enlisting a new dancer, a Mexican waitress named Catalina, whom he runs into during a drunken bender in the troupe's New Mexico town. Also, Lodz and Lila wait for Ben to finally succumb to sleep, with a little of Ruthie's help, so Lodz can probe Ben's dreams.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d90a6885dedf105a44735ae4d5aa99b8a30da555","amp;dn":"Carnivale+Season+1+Disc+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d90a6885dedf105a44735ae4d5aa99b8a30da555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,10,104,133,222,223,16,90,68,115,90,228,213,170,153,184,163,13,165,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
