The virtualized ProxyCap\nsimply isolates itself from being detected as a non-genuine version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f430092c9d2f1eb744b95108fcd7936b0183494","amp;dn":"ProxyCap+5.01.6+Pre-Cracked+with+LifeTime+Registration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f430092c9d2f1eb744b95108fcd7936b0183494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,67,0,146,201,210,241,235,116,75,149,16,143,205,121,54,176,24,52,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
