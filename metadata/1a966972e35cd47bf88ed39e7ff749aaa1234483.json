All of the vocals (except on the live tracks) are by Edmunds, and many of the songs are true solo efforts in that Edmunds also plays all the instruments. The album produced two Top 10 singles in the UK, remakes of the Phil Spector hit &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; and The Chordettes' &quot;Born to Be with You&quot;. A 2006 reissue of the album includes two former B-sides as bonus tracks.\n\nStudio album by Dave Edmunds\nrockabilly \n\nReleased\nApril 1975 \n\nRecorded\nRockfield Studios, Wales \n\nGenre\nRock and roll \n\nLength\n37:20 \n\nLabel\nRCA Records \n\nProducer\nDave Edmunds for Rockfield Productions \n\nTrack listing\nSide A\n\n1.&quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; (Phil Spector, Ellie Greenwich, Jeff Barry) - 3:33\n2.&quot;Leave My Woman Alone&quot; (Ray Charles) - 2:39\n3.&quot;Maybe&quot; (Richard Barrett) - 2:55\n4.&quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; (Spector, Greenwich, Barry) - 2:22\n5.&quot;Let It Be Me&quot; (Gilbert BÃƒÂ©caud, Mann Curtis, Pierre DelanoÃƒÂ«) - 2:47\n6.&quot;No Money Down&quot; (live) (Chuck Berry) - 3:52\nSide B\n\n7.&quot;A Shot of Rhythm and Blues&quot; (Terry Thompson) - 2:44\n8.&quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (arranged by Dave Edmunds) - 3:36\n9.&quot;Born to Be with You&quot; (Don Robertson) - 3:33\n10.&quot;She's My Baby&quot; (Nick Lowe) - 3:38\n11.&quot;I Ain't Never&quot; (Mel Tillis, Webb Pierce) - 3:16\n12.&quot;Let It Rock&quot; (live) (Berry) - 3:01Ã¢â‚¬â€bonus tracks (2006 reissue)--\n13.&quot;Pick Axe Rag&quot; (Edmunds, Mickey Gee) - 2:56\n14.&quot;Some Other Guy&quot; (Richard Barrett, Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller) - 2:25\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a966972e35cd47bf88ed39e7ff749aaa1234483","amp;dn":"Subtle+as+a+Flying+Mallet+%281975%29+24bit-96khz+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a966972e35cd47bf88ed39e7ff749aaa1234483","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,150,105,114,227,92,212,123,248,142,211,158,127,247,73,170,161,35,68,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
