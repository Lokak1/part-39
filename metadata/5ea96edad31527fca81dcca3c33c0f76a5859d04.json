(1994)\n\nOn April 21, 1968, three days before his thirty-first birthday, Joe Henderson was o veteran musician who had established himself with an impressive series of recordings. He had played with everybody, it seemed, and heard just about everything. And by this time the Wynton Kelly Trio, featuring Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums, was one of the most celebrated in modern jazz. Although Joe worried that by joining them for this gig he would, in his words, &quot;appear to be intruding on this hallowed ground&quot;, the results are fascinating, even historic. Here's one of the last recorded performances by this stalwart rhythm section, sounding different than it ever had before, with Henderson prying open its classic routines with extended solos.

Four\n3. On the Trail\n4. Star Dust/Old Folks\n5. On Green Dolphin Street\n6. The Theme\n\nJoe Henderson (ts) with Wynton Kelly (p); Paul Chambers (b); Jimmy Cobb (d).\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea96edad31527fca81dcca3c33c0f76a5859d04","amp;dn":"Joe+Henderson+with+the+Wynton+Kelly+Trio+-+1968+-+Four%21+%281994%29+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea96edad31527fca81dcca3c33c0f76a5859d04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,169,110,218,211,21,39,252,168,29,204,163,195,60,15,118,165,133,157,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
