But a fresh start on Juniper Landing Island was exactly what she and her family needed. For the first time in years she and her sister hang out at the beach, gossip about boys, and party together. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also made friends with a local clique-including a magnetic and mysterious boy named Tristan.\n\nBut RoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world is about to change again. Picturesque Juniper Landing isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what it seems. The truth about the swirling fog that rolls in each morning, the bridge that leads to nowhere, and those beautiful locals who seem to watch RoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every move is more terrifying than being hunted by Steven Nell. And all Rory ever wanted was the truth. Even if it means learning that she can never go home again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b6a701e61f45f046bf5c7bae7a09c8442679c54","amp;dn":"Hereafter_Brian_Kate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b6a701e61f45f046bf5c7bae7a09c8442679c54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,106,112,30,97,244,95,4,107,245,199,186,231,160,156,132,66,103,156,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
