Sorry for that.\n\nI'm just wondering how it could be that when I originally seeded this one for over 2 gigs in the beginning and in decent speed, there's no completed download around? It's hard to believe. I bet that someone completed this before but they're not seeding.\n\nAnd all I get is a grief when somebody gets stuck. Is it really only my job to seed these forever? Not quite fair or is it?\n\nI'm becoming sick and tired for all those mofos who are anxiously dowloading the stuff but then not seeding it forward. And it's always me who gets the shit from other users for that... Shame on you!\n\nBut well... Here it goes again. And this time; if you complete it - SEED IT! Please! Thanx!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Complete Album @ 320kbps *\n* CD-covers included *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:886eac1a75ae5a1d152c66ce5727a612a34e5931","amp;dn":"M%C3%83%C2%B6tley+Cr%C3%83%C2%BCe+-+Saints+of+Los+Angeles+%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"886eac1a75ae5a1d152c66ce5727a612a34e5931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,110,172,26,117,174,90,29,21,44,102,206,87,39,166,18,163,78,89,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
