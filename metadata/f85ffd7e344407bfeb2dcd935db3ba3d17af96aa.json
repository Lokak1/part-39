The band released\nits first two albums, &quot;Understand This Is A Dream&quot; (1999) and &quot;Emotion Is Dead&quot;\n(2000), as well as the &quot;Music from Another Room ep&quot; (2001) on the independent\nlabel Tooth and Nail Records. In 2002, the band signed to Epic Records and\nreleased the acclaimed cd ?Love? (2003). When not in the studio, the band has\nbeen on the road, criss-crossing the US/Canada over a dozen times and touring\nEurope and Australia. The Juliana Theory is now hard at work putting the\nfinishing touches on their brand new record, ?DEADBEAT SWEETHEARTBEAT.? Expect\nan early fall 2005 release on the band's own imprint label Paper Fist.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85ffd7e344407bfeb2dcd935db3ba3d17af96aa","amp;dn":"The_Juliana_Theory-Deadbeat_Sweetheartbeat-%28Advance%29-2005-RTB+%5BR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85ffd7e344407bfeb2dcd935db3ba3d17af96aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,95,253,126,52,68,7,191,235,45,205,147,93,179,186,61,23,175,150,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
