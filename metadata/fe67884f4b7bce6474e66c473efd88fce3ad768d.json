And, what, he asks, is the ethical point of all this personal testimony? What has it really taught us?\n\nUnderlying the entire book is a question of how the Holocaust has shaped the possibilities for truth and for the writing of an authentic life story in today's world, and how we can approach the world in a meaningful way. Hartman produces a meditation on how an appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of art and writing may help us to answer these questions of meaning.\n\nAbout the author: Geoffrey Hartman is one of America's most renowned literary critics. He is the Sterling Professor (Emeritus) of English &amp; Comparative Literature at Yale University and cofounder and Project Director of the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Hartman successfully recasts some of our basic questions -- and it is perhaps through our questions that we understand our human predicament.&quot; -- Library Journal\n\n&quot;Hartman carefully shows how reading can lead us to our authentic selves.&quot; --Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;In 13 personal essays, Hartman examines the interaction between life and art, focusing on concerns about the authentic.&quot; -- W.F. Williams, Choice\n\n&quot;This is a profound, learned, impassioned meditation on the role literary study can play in invigorating the imaginative life of our civilization -- without which it is difficult to imagine having a civilization at all.&quot; -- Jonathan Rosen\n\n&quot;A certain kind of reading -- end driven, moving toward the satisfaction of conclusion and resolution -- is not the pleasure given by this text; and indeed were the text to give it, it would be in tension with its own mode of thinking, a mode of thinking we can weakly call dialectic, moving back and forth between the noting of appearance and fakery everywhere and the equally omnipresent desire for the real. In the experience it provides, this beautifully written book is truer to the lesson it would teach: the difficulty and necessity of the search for the authentic.&quot; -- Stanley Fish\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe67884f4b7bce6474e66c473efd88fce3ad768d","amp;dn":"Geoffrey+Hartman+-+Scars+of+the+Spirit+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe67884f4b7bce6474e66c473efd88fce3ad768d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,103,136,79,75,123,206,100,116,230,108,71,62,253,136,252,227,173,118,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
