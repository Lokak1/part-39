Therefore, I decided to write this practical helping book in statistics. The book aims to be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“recipe bookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for students dealing with their Bachelor, Master or PhD theses or persons and scientists interested in data analysis in general. Limited knowledge in statistical thinking directly affects the quality of their experimental design and research outcome. The content of this book will help to perform high-quality statistical analyses of scientific data with no additional costs. For this the reader does not need to be an expert in statistics. Just copy and paste the syntax of commands in this book and apply them on your own specific data set. This will further help to understand statistics in more detail. The secret is to perform many analyses on multiple data sets to get a feeling for the different statistical models. The first part of this book will be helpful for all readers. The second part is dealing with some more advanced models that may be of interest only for a fraction of readers depending on the nature of their data.  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be76c74096bc0fb63f68303b59404725365db28d","amp;dn":"Altincicek_statistics_book_2013.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be76c74096bc0fb63f68303b59404725365db28d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,118,199,64,150,188,15,182,63,104,48,59,89,64,71,37,54,93,178,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
