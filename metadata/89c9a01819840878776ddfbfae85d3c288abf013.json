Lonesome Sundown's rural Louisiana blues were a mainstay of the Excello label, while Phillip Walker gained visibility through his association with producer Bruce Bromberg in the late 1960s. These Bromberg produced tracks include several of Walker's earliest Vault and Joliet sides, and later sides by Sundown, backed by Walker's Band and the late great George 'Harmonica' Smith.\n\n01.
