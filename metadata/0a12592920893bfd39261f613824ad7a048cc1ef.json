This is universally considered the best version of The Messiah that has ever been put to video.  It is also Extremely rare and out of print, so I am sharing my copy. I am uploading the entire DVD folder so you should be able to create a DVD using any good DVD copy program.  I used DVDFab7 to create it. Enjoy.\n\nFeaturing:\n\nLynne Dawson - Soprano\n\nHillary Summers - Alto\n\nJohn Mark Ainsley - Tenor\n\nAlastair Miles - Bass\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a12592920893bfd39261f613824ad7a048cc1ef","amp;dn":"The+Messiah+-+George+Frideric+Handel+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a12592920893bfd39261f613824ad7a048cc1ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,18,89,41,32,137,59,253,57,38,31,97,56,36,173,122,4,140,193,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
