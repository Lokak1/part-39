Singer sounds a bit like Janis Joplin. This band used to play with famous guitarplayer Tommy Brolin, but broke up with him, and this record is what came out after the breakup. Very good, in my opinion.\n\nI will not seed 24/7, but as often I can, so just leave the download running and youÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ll get it eventually. Worth the download..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55f242135fbdfb3f232502d6b205e3df1b1a058","amp;dn":"Zephyr+-+Sunset+ride+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55f242135fbdfb3f232502d6b205e3df1b1a058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,95,36,33,53,251,223,179,242,50,80,45,107,32,94,61,241,177,160,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
