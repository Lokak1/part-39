Along the way, they get lost in East St. Louis (in what some may consider a racist scene involving black youths stripping the brand-new family station wagon clean while Clark Griswold [Chase (Imogene Coca), dispose of her corpse after she passes away in the back seat, narrowly skirt death after crashing through a roadside billboard in the desert, and stay at a hotel where Clark is tempted by a seductive swimmer (Christie Brinkley). Having endured a journey more trying than Homer's -Odyssey, they finally arrive at WallyWorld -- only to find it is closed for two weeks for renovations. Wackiness ensues as Clark snaps and takes a security guard (John Candy) hostage. Chase is good as everyman Clark Griswold, as is D'Angelo as his wife, and Candy is a scene-stealer as a stodgy, dim-witted park security guard. Among the funniest scenes are Clark's swim at the motel, the visit to the Grand Canyon, and the encounter with the state trooper regarding Aunt Edna's missing dog.\n\nCast: Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Imogene Coca (Aunt Edna), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), Anthony Michael Hall (Russell 'Rusty' Griswold), Dana Barron (Audrey Griswold), Eddie Bracken (Roy Walley), Brian Doyle-Murray (Kamp Komfort Clerk), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), James Keach (Motorcycle Cop), Eugene Levy (Car Salesman), Frank McRae (Grover), John Candy (Lasky, Guard at Walleyworld), Christie Brinkley (The Girl in the Ferrari), Jane Krakowski (Cousin Vicki), All Cast &amp; Crew... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/fullcredits#cast\n\nSoundtrack: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/soundtrack\n\nUSE DIRECT FROM PC to TV - DVI or VGA CONNECTORS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1dfe42e9b948eb79ad7161ca2bf651d821045af","amp;dn":"Vacation%5B1983%5DDVDRip.x264-m99m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1dfe42e9b948eb79ad7161ca2bf651d821045af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,223,228,46,155,148,142,183,154,215,22,28,162,191,101,29,130,16,69,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
