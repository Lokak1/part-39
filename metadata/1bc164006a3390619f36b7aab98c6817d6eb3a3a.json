While in Dino Autopsy we get under the skin of a dinosaur with exclusive access to the excavation of one of the most intact dinosaur mummies ever found.\n\nDino Autopsy is a discovery that promises to transform what scientists believe about the dinosaur ? a virtually intact dino mummy. Nearly everything we know of dinosaurs comes from bones and teeth, usually the only tissue durable enough to fossilize. The conditions that preserved this extraordinary mummy were one in a million, and early examination offers never-before-seen details of what they really looked like, as well as clues to how they moved and lived. The paleontologists involved already believe that this could prove to be one of the most important dinosaur discoveries of all time.\n\nThe recently discovered partially intact dino mummy, named Dakota, is one of the most important dinosaur discoveries in recent times calling into question our conception of dinosaurs? body shape, skin preservation and movement.\n\nFossilised skin and tendons have allowed us to reconstruct major muscle sizes, with many body parts offering a tantalising glimpse of a 3-D dinosaur.\n\nThe scan of the 3,600kg body was of the one of the largest CT scans ever undertaken!\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.3\nVideo Bitrate: 2081 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x432\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.593:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 47:00.400\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 745MB\nSubtitles: No subs\nRipped by: jvt40 www mvgroup org avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bc164006a3390619f36b7aab98c6817d6eb3a3a","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Dino+Autopsy+DVB+Xvid+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bc164006a3390619f36b7aab98c6817d6eb3a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,193,100,0,106,51,144,97,159,54,183,170,185,140,104,23,214,235,58,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
