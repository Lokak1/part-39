As he wields his\nbrush, we see through the canvas as the artwork unfolds, erupts, dances into being before our eyes.\nPablo Picasso, the most influential artist of the twentieth century, is making a painting, and Henri-Georges Clouzot, the famous French director (The Wages of Fear, Diabolique), is making a movie.\n\nIn 1955, Clouzot joined forces with his friend Picasso to make an entirely new kind of art film - a film that could capture the moment and the mystery of creativity. Together, they devised an innovative technique - the filmmaker placed his camera behind a semi-transparent surface on which the artist drew with special inks that bled through.\n\nClouzot thus captured a perfect reverse image of Picasso&amp;#039;s brushstrokes and the motion picture screen itself becomes the artist&amp;#039;s canvas. Here, the master creates, and sometimes obliterates, 20 works (most of them, in fact, destroyed after the shoot), ranging from playful black-and-white sketches to Cinemascope color murals - artworks which evolve in minutes through the magic of stop-motion animation. Unavailable for more than a decade, The Mystery of Picasso is exhilarating, mesmerizing, enchanting and unforgettable. It is simply one of the greatest documentaries on art ever made. The French government agreed - in 1984 it declared the film a national treasure.\n\n\nExtra: Guernica\n(1950), a film, by Alain Resnais (Last Year at Marienbad, La Guerre est finie) and Robert Hessens that uses various works by Picasso along with images of newspaper headlines to illustrate an anti-war sentiment, with his mural Guernica (1935-7), painted as a cry against the Spanish Civil War, as its centerpiece. The reading reads like a Beat anthem-it was written by poet Paul Eluard-and is supported by a properly discordant score. The image shows the wear of time and has a preponderant darkness, but one can still be moved by its content as intended.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1543 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: French\nRunTime Per Part: 1:14:34 (10546752 Frames)\nPart Size: 895MB\nSubtitles: English/Portuguese\nRipped by: Dentje\nExtra:\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1876 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x448\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.429:1\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 105kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: French\nRunTime Per Part: 13:12\nPart Size: 185MB\nSubtitles: English/Portuguese\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Further Information \n* Very interesting pdf on the making of the film\n\n2) Related Documentaries \n* Pablo Picasso\n* Picasso: The Full Story\n* Great Artists\n* Power of Art\n* Art of Spain\n\nMVGroup.Forum.avi\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Mystery_of_Picasso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b7e1bdf1827305f1edae1b61d4963234340542","amp;dn":"The.Mystery.of.Picasso.Extra.Guernica.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b7e1bdf1827305f1edae1b61d4963234340542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,183,225,189,241,130,115,5,241,237,174,27,97,212,150,50,52,52,5,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
