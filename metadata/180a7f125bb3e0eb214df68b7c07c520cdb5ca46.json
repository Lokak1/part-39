Daniel?s gritty black and white film uncovers a secret society and it?s underground universe of hobo and railworker graffiti, and includes interviews with legendary boxcar artists, Coaltrain, Herby, Colossus of Roads, and The Rambler. Shooting over a 16-year period, Daniel rode freights across the West carrying a Super-8 sound camera and a 16mm Bolex. During his quest he discovered the roots of a folkloric tradition that has gone mostly unnoticed for a century. Taking inspiration from Beat artists Robert Frank and Jack Kerouac, the film functions as both a sub-cultural documentary and a stylized fable on wanderlust and outsider identity. ?I was drawn to the subject by the universal graffiti impulse and the classic, corny notion of freight train blues escape.?\n\n\nWHO IS BOZO TEXINO?\nthe secret history of hobo graffiti\nDirected, photographed, edited by Bill Daniel\n2005, 56 min, B/W, 16mm and Super 8, mastered on Digibeta NTSC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180a7f125bb3e0eb214df68b7c07c520cdb5ca46","amp;dn":"Who+is+Bozo+Texino%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180a7f125bb3e0eb214df68b7c07c520cdb5ca46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,10,127,18,91,179,224,235,33,77,246,139,124,7,197,32,205,181,202,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
