Works with Poser and D|S, MATs need some tweaking in D|S. Also included the dress and the puzzle box. (Someone already had them all together so why break them apart?) There is a seam issue with the displacement on the top of the head, this is how it was released, don't like it? Pay for it and bitch at the author. IMO it shouldn't be that hard to use these items on the newer G2 figures (considering they support most of everything from V4)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83ec7a4d22ae888ae476f22d53730dcc0e359a47","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+-+Poser+-+Quilty+the+Runtime+Raiser+%28and+freebies%29%28RO+6664","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83ec7a4d22ae888ae476f22d53730dcc0e359a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,236,122,77,34,174,136,138,228,118,242,45,83,115,13,204,14,53,154,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
