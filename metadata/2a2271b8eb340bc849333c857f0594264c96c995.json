Originally broadcast as an FLV movie, here&amp;#039;s a DVD version for those who&amp;#039;d like to see it on their TV. \n\nAs VDGG kicked off their latest tour in Manchester last night (27-3-08, great gig featuring lots of new material), I thought that it&amp;#039;d be nice to share this DVD from their superb tour of 2007.\n\nDetails: PAL format, region free. \nUsers from the US, Canada, Japan, Korea and other NTSC countries may like to note that they may experience problems if their standalone DVD player or TV cannot handle the European PAL standard but it should still work in their PCs. \n\nRunning time 1 hr 54 mins.\nAspect ratio: 4:3 letterboxed (watchable area 16:9), suitable for all TVs.\n\nVan Der Graaf Generator live at the Amsterdam Paradiso 14-4-07.\n11 Songs:\n- Lemmings\n- A Place To Survive\n- Lifetime\n- (In The) Black Room\n- Every Bloody Emperor\n- All That Before\n- Gog\n- Meurglys III, The Songwriter&amp;#039;s Guild\n- The Sleepwalkers\n- Man Erg\n- Scorched Earth\n\nLineage:\n- Site rip using FLV Recorder\n- Conversion to MPG2 using Super\n- DVD authored using TMPGEncDVDAuthor3\n\nPicture and sound quality is about as good as could be expected from the original 457MB FLV file. It&amp;#039;s very watchable, trust me!\n\nNo cover artwork included. If you decide to design a cover, how about sharing it and linking to it from a comment made about this post.\n\nPlease note that I have a slow upload speed and this will take literally weeks to upload. I will commit to seeing the initial upload through to completion. You can help others by continuing to seed once you have downloaded the DVD and, if you do so, God will certainly welcome you to Heaven with open arms, I promise. I have His word on it. If you fail to share by seeding after completion, I can guarantee that the guy with the horns and the pointy tail will welcome you to a very hot place after you snuff it, chums.\n\nNOT FOR SALE\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a2271b8eb340bc849333c857f0594264c96c995","amp;dn":"Van+Der+Graaf+Generator+-+Amsterdam+2007+-+PAL+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a2271b8eb340bc849333c857f0594264c96c995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,34,113,184,235,52,11,200,73,51,60,133,127,5,148,38,76,150,201,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
