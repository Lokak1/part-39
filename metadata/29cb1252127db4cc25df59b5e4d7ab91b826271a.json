The authentic supply and demand-based trading system allows players to grow their business and head out to the high seas to form trading routes with other Hanseatic cities negotiating better prices for the buying and selling of goods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29cb1252127db4cc25df59b5e4d7ab91b826271a","amp;dn":"Patrician.IV.English-Ali213","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29cb1252127db4cc25df59b5e4d7ab91b826271a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,203,18,82,18,125,180,204,37,223,89,181,228,215,171,145,184,38,39,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
