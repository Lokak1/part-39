Simply run the program and choose which iTunes playlist to convert. Then choose where to save the converted\nplaylist (I recomend saving it in you &quot;My Music&quot; directory since TVersity automatically scans there for audio). Once that is done, you open TVersity and click on &quot;Library&quot; on the top bar. Then, under &quot;Sources&quot; in the side bar, choose &quot;File System&quot; and then &quot;Files&quot;. Click on &quot;+ Add Item&quot; and hit &quot;Browse&quot;. Find your converted playlist and open it. TVersity will then scan that playlist file and add it to the server for you to listen to on other devices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5647e9df942d6382407dc34d64128c95924df163","amp;dn":"iTunesExporter+and+TVersity+Pro+1.9.7+with+Licence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5647e9df942d6382407dc34d64128c95924df163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,71,233,223,148,45,99,130,64,125,195,77,100,18,140,149,146,77,241,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
