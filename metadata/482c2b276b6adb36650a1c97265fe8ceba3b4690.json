Glendale, CA), bassist Gianni Neiviller (b. Hollywood, CA) and drummer Rocco Bidlovski (b. Brazil); Bidlovski had previously played with the South American band Tokyo before coming to the U.S. The group's California punk/hardcore attitude and style is laced with melodic power-pop on two releases, the Slammin' EP and 1995's debut album New Disease, produced by Geza X (Black Flag, Dead Kennedys).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:482c2b276b6adb36650a1c97265fe8ceba3b4690","amp;dn":"1000+Mona+Lisas+-+New+Disease+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"482c2b276b6adb36650a1c97265fe8ceba3b4690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,44,43,39,107,106,219,54,101,10,28,151,38,95,232,206,186,59,70,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
