A multifaceted woman, she was knowledgeable about everything from politics to agriculture. Her endeavours to rebuild her failing empire, however, never came to fruition.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4bd2fb00d5be601fbf8fe46be6ba430c38b7c5","amp;dn":"Cleopatra+-+Michael+Grant++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4bd2fb00d5be601fbf8fe46be6ba430c38b7c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,75,210,251,0,213,190,96,31,191,143,228,107,230,186,67,12,56,183,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
