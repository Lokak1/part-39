Its purpose is to aid in the formulation of analytical questions related to a particular photograph and to assist scientists unfamiliar with analysis of photographs when interpreting analytical data. The Atlas contains interpretation guides with identification of overlaps of spectral peaks and warnings of potential misidentification or misinterpretation of analytical results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:442e26cafd3cc76bda8741bfc20805c652e787f8","amp;dn":"The+Atlas+of+Analytical+Signatures+of+Photographic+Processes+%28Hi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"442e26cafd3cc76bda8741bfc20805c652e787f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,46,38,202,253,60,199,107,218,135,65,191,194,8,5,198,82,231,135,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
