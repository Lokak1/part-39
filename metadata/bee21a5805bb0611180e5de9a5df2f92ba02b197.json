The term 'wood coatings' covers a broad range of products including stains, varnishes, paints and supporting ancillary products that may be used indoors or outdoors.\nTechniques for coating wood go back many centuries but in recent decades there has been a move towards more environmentally-friendly materials, for example, the use of water-borne rather than solvent-borne chemicals.\nA major objective of Wood Coatings is to explain the underlying factors that influence selection, application and general operational issues. Basic information on the chemistry and technology of coatings is included for the benefit of students and laboratory technicians. Additionally, the book includes individual chapters of interest to architects, specifiers, and industrial users.\n\n* Offers up-to-date guidance on current availability and usage of wood coatings\n* Provides the reader with a basic understanding of both coating and substrate interactions\n* Covers both architectural (trade and DIY) and industrial sectors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bee21a5805bb0611180e5de9a5df2f92ba02b197","amp;dn":"Industrial+Wood+Coatings+-+Theory+and+Practice+2009+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bee21a5805bb0611180e5de9a5df2f92ba02b197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,226,26,88,5,187,6,17,24,14,93,233,165,223,47,146,186,2,177,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
