River rents the guest house behind VioletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crumbling estate, and as eerie, grim things start to happen, Violet begins to wonder about the boy living in her backyard.\nIs River just a crooked-smiling liar with pretty eyes and a mysterious past? Or could he be something more?\nVioletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandmother always warned her about the Devil, but she never said he could be a dark-haired boy who takes naps in the sun, who likes coffee, who kisses you in a cemetery... who makes you want to kiss back.\nVioletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already so knee-deep in love, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see straight. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just how River likes it.\nGenre: Paranormal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2cbcab5b3dbc930aada786087b5e18aa41fccc5","amp;dn":"Between+the+Devil+and+the+Deep+Blue+Sea+by+April+Genevieve+Tucho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2cbcab5b3dbc930aada786087b5e18aa41fccc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,203,202,181,179,219,201,48,170,218,120,96,135,181,225,138,164,31,204,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
