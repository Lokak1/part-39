And how could it be otherwise, when artists and audience members of a certain (i.e., middle) age get together for a 107-minute soul/R&amp;B revue that encompasses two or three decades of terrific songs and performances? Originally broadcast by PBS, the 18-song show includes everything from soul standards like &quot;Respect&quot; (sung by a rather hefty but still effective Aretha Franklin) to disco hymns like Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will Survive&quot; and Thelma Houston's magnificent &quot;Don't Leave Me This Way,&quot; with a few ballad chestnuts (Blue Magic's &quot;Side Show,&quot; Peaches and Herb's &quot;Reunited&quot;) added for good measure. OK, so some of these folks are a bit past their primes. But for the most part, this program (which includes several backstage interviews) is less about nostalgia than simply having a darn good time. --\n\nProduct Description\n\nThis live DVD serves as the companion to the highly successful PBS concert pledge special and CD box set. This event captures the greatest R&amp;B performers and their music in a truly unforgettable live setting.
