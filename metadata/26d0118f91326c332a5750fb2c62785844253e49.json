The use of many different herbs and spices make each dish quite unique. Each different region in India is known for it's wide selection of different recipes and Indian cooking styles and tastes. Though about one third of the population is strictly vegetarian, there are many different dishes that include chicken, lamb and goat meat. In India though the cow is thought of as a sacred animal therefore you will not find many recipes including beef. Food is such an important part of Indian culture as in most cultures, and plays an important role in the family life and in festival celebrations. Most families in India still sit down together to enjoy their meals with one another. There are a couple of main courses and they are usually served along with different pickles, chutneys and of course different types of Indian bread, which is called &quot;roti&quot;. There is also usually a dessert served as well.\n\nIndian cooking has many different styles throughtout all of India. For that matter, there is really not one accepted style of Indian cuisine but rather many different styles. So if you travel to India you will find that the food prepared by the people and restaurants in that area will be different in each area. Of course there will be some similarities but it will also be very different from place to place\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/50fb/8bb20cef.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/50fb/8bb20cef.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d0118f91326c332a5750fb2c62785844253e49","amp;dn":"Three+Indian+Recipes+Books+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d0118f91326c332a5750fb2c62785844253e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,208,17,143,145,50,108,51,42,87,80,251,44,98,120,88,68,37,62,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
