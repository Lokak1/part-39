Her son Scott is mortified. He still can't believe that his father - a world-class athlete - actually drowned. When Maureen and Oliver announce wedding-plans, Scott's world begins to fall apart. Oliver's attractive daughter Kelly shares Scott's distrust of the impending marriage - and proposes a theory of her own: is it possible that Maureen and Oliver have known each other longer than just a few weeks; and if so, could they have possibly killed Scott's father? The two start to investigate - and soon fall in love. But while they are united by a horrible suspicion, the investigation soon reveals some secrets that keep them apart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3381f5db85b1fb60457c0116e4a6e1d56e095f28","amp;dn":"Fascination+%282004%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3381f5db85b1fb60457c0116e4a6e1d56e095f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,129,245,219,133,177,251,96,69,124,1,22,228,166,225,213,110,9,95,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
