Bryson marshals an impressive amount of research to demonstrate fluorideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harmfulness, the ties between leading fluoride researchers and the corporations who funded and benefited from their research, and what he says is the duplicity with which fluoridation was sold to the people. Although flouride is today being removed from just about every product its impact is still all around us. Find out how powerful corporate interests propagated the idea of flouridation being harmless to life although research has clearly shown it has deadly effects on any life form it gets in contact with. This amazingly documented book refutes the mass of commercially motivated lies and propaganda about fluoride, giving us the facts and motivation we need to make the effort to keep this poisonous substance out of our lives. 400 pages, some pictures. A must read from everyone.\n\nFrom a webreview:\nA chronicle of the abuse of power and of the manufacture of state-sponsored medical propaganda, The Fluoride Deception reveals how military and industry scientists and public health officials buried information about fluoride&amp;#039;s potential for human harm, while promoting its use in dentistry. \nThe Fluoride Deception reveals that fluoride pollution was the greatest legal threat facing the wartime Manhattan Project. And the book documents how a secretive group of powerful industries, who all faced extensive litigation for flouride pollution, collaborated with the Institute of Dental Research to launder flouride&amp;#039;s image. We&amp;#039;ll meet the dissident scientists who warned us about fluoride from the beginning. We&amp;#039;ll sit with the famous doctor who&amp;#039;d alerted America in the 1950&amp;#039;s to the dangers of cigarette smoking, who reported that fluoride was a systemic poison, with tens of thousands of citizens uniquely sensitive to even tiny doses. We&amp;#039;ll walk the cobbled streets of Donora, Pennsylvania, in the shrouded aftermath of the nation&amp;#039;s most notorious air pollution disaster in 1948, and meet the scientist who blamed -fluoride for the deaths. \nToday, that scientist joins a growing number of health experts who call fluoride a venomous and hydra-headed poison. They suspect its involvement in a host of modern illnesses, including arthritis, bone cancer, and emphysema, and a spectrum of central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer&amp;#039;s disease and the epidemic of attention deficit disorder sweeping America&amp;#039;s children.\n\nMore info at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-deception.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-deception.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://us.altnews.com.au/drop/node/view/392&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://us.altnews.com.au/drop/node/view/392&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27569d0d9192bce344b4c4f34dfaca6ca024ffd0","amp;dn":"Bryson-Fluoride+Deception%28flouridation+is+toxic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27569d0d9192bce344b4c4f34dfaca6ca024ffd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,86,157,13,145,146,188,227,68,180,196,243,77,250,202,108,160,36,255,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
