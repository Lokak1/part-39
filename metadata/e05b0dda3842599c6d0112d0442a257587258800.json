Instead, its a Rasputin like figure of\nan old long-bearded homosexual man with a voice too many octaves too strained\nto sound like he would have real integrity in pursuing the affair - given her own \nhonest needs that is. This, she says is her thrill - in fact &quot;she doesn't want to\ncarry a child - unless its his - otherwise she wants it not to be born&quot; - she\nloves this Rasputin like man she says - because in her own words - &quot;he is cold\nand wise&quot;\n\nWho wants cold?!!!!!!!!!! (weird!) Keep the advice to yourself my dear!\nFurthermore Dear Emma, the words &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;wise&quot; are mutually exclusive\nas a way of life option I submit in the strongest possible terms of what is\nChristianly endeavour - hoping for better choices for all in what spirit we\nstrive to maintain in our lives for as long as we choose to live on.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\nHope we get a 720p version soon somehow - great sex!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e05b0dda3842599c6d0112d0442a257587258800","amp;dn":"Carrington+%281995%29+Ms.+Emma+Thomspon+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+DivX+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e05b0dda3842599c6d0112d0442a257587258800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,91,13,218,56,66,89,156,109,1,18,208,68,42,37,117,135,37,136,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
