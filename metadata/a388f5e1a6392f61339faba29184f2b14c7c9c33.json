Bush made a special effort on behalf of this collection ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ originally an LP ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ by re-recording and remixing her debut hit &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;; she felt that her teenaged vocal didn't properly represent the song and, in fact, at one point thought to re-do the vocals on several other of the early numbers included. The collection is an excellent overview, presenting the many sides of her music, and bookending her whole career through 1984, from her debut to her then newest single, &quot;Experiment IV&quot;; nor is it confined exclusively to major hits, as important lesser-charting entries are also featured. As with Bush's other LP-era releases, American listeners thinking of buying this collection should be aware that the British CD edition was mastered from tapes that were at least one generation up on their American counterparts and, thus, sounds distinctly better than the U.S. version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a388f5e1a6392f61339faba29184f2b14c7c9c33","amp;dn":"Kate+Bush+-+The+Whole+Story+%281986%29+%5BEAC-LAME+320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a388f5e1a6392f61339faba29184f2b14c7c9c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,136,245,225,166,57,47,97,51,159,171,162,145,132,242,177,76,124,156,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
