Bought it because it looked interesting, I think they might be Canadian, judging by the images. Great rock sound. A little grungy maybe? Not too much though. Some of the acoustic is amazing, makes me think.\n\nIf ANYONE know ANYTHING about these guys please message me. I think they are awesome and I don't know anything about them. The only thing I know is that they are from 1996. Anyway, enjoy the music, it's great.\n\nPlease Seed, I'll try to seed as much as possible, but I can't always leave my laptop on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f6fc9a823b9bb586240a0980c6ed21e707f4c1b","amp;dn":"Rush+The+Growler+-+RTG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f6fc9a823b9bb586240a0980c6ed21e707f4c1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,111,201,168,35,185,187,88,98,64,160,152,12,110,210,30,112,127,76,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
