That, of course, is quite understandable since almost all of the world\\&amp;#039;s religious and social philosophies have little use for the individual except as a tool to be placed in service to their notion of something else: \\&amp;#039;God,\\&amp;#039; or the \\&amp;#039;collective,\\&amp;#039; or the \\&amp;#039;higher good\\&amp;#039; or some other equally undefinable term. Only rarely, such as in Zen; in Ayn Rand\\&amp;#039;s philosophy of Objectivism; in some aspects of Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism; and in some schools of Existentialism, is the individual considered primal. Here, finally, is a book which celebrates, encourages and educates the best part of ourselves --- The Psychopath.\n\nThe Psychopath\\&amp;#039;s Bible\nFor the Extreme Individual\n\nwritten by Christopher S.
