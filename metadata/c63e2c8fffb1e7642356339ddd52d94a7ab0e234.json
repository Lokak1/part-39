McQuade is a Texas Ranger who doesn&amp;#039;t exactly follow the rules, is unruly, and prefers to work alone, which earns the nickname, Lone Wolf McQuade. When he discovers some criminals have automatic weapons, he discovers that they were stolen from the military. He tries to handle on his own, as usual, but in the end, an old friend, and a prisoner, whom he was keeping under wraps, are killed. He is then relieved of duty. But then an FBI agent, who also wants to get these guys, offers to help McQuade, and along with a rookie, they track down the mastermind.\n\n\nXvid 768kbps 23.976 528x288 , Mp3 48khz 132 vbr .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c63e2c8fffb1e7642356339ddd52d94a7ab0e234","amp;dn":"Lone+Wolf+McQuade+1983+Chuck+Norris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c63e2c8fffb1e7642356339ddd52d94a7ab0e234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,62,44,143,255,177,231,100,35,86,51,157,221,82,217,74,122,176,226,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
