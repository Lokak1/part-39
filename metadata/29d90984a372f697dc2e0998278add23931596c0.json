The main idea was to have the ability to pop a USB thumb Drive into any PC and to be able to play Classic Goodness anywhere with a nice frontend. Unfortunately M$ turned off autoload from USB which makes my original dream impossible (as far as i know). None of these games are my original works and credit goes to those who work long and hard to get these great games running where we could play them. I did make the frontend and Custom art for the buttons. I have spent a lot of time in getting this to run but it does not mean that it is perfect as of yet. Some games may still crash or some of the expansion may not load properly. If you need to change settings you can dig into the folders ( DATA AutoPlay Docs GOG ) my origination is lacking but all the files are there if you dig. Each game has a EXE or BAT in their main folders that will launch the games from there. You can run this from anywhere I believe but of course it was designed for a USB Thumb drive. It can be started from the DATA folder by running the autorun.exe. Please feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll try and fix them.\n\n**note** if Half-life (including Blue shift and opposing force) ask for a key just \t put in AAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA to get it to load.\n\nGame List. \n\nALien Trilogy\nBlake Stone - Aliens of gold and Planet Strike\nBlood + Crytpic Passage\nBlood 2\nCatacombs Collection\nCounter-Strike\nDoom - Doom 2 - Heretic - Hexen - Strife\nUltimate Doom + Doom 2 (Odamex + Multiplayer)\nDuke Nukem Atomic &amp; Megaton Edition\nHalf-Life - Blue Shift - Oppossing Force\nHexen 2 plus Expansions\nMarathon - Marathon 2 Durandal - Marathon Infinity\nPowerslave\nQuake plus expansions\nQuake 2 plus expansions \nQuake 3 Arena and Team Arena\nRedneck Rampage - RR Sucking on Grits on Route 66 - RR Rides Again\nRise of the Triad Dark War\nShadow Warrior Complete\nStar Wars Dark Forces\nSystem Shock - System Shock 2\nTekWar\nTerminator Future SHock - Terminator Rampage\nUnreal Tournament\nWolfenstein 3D &amp; Spear of Destiny\n42 games Total\n\nthank you for playing.\n\nVersion History\n__________________________________\nVersion 3\n\nFixed Frontend\n\nAdded Quake - Scourge of Armagon\n      Quake - Dissolution of Eternity\n      Quake 2 - The Reckoning \n      Quake 2 - Ground Zero\n      Quake 3 Team Arena\n__________________________________\nVersion 2\n\nAdded Semi Working Frontend\n\nAdded Unreal Tournament\n      Counter-Strike\n      Half-Life\n      Half-life - Blue Shift\n      Half-life - Opposing Force\n      Duke Nukem Megaton Edition\n__________________________________\nVersion 1\n\nGames were loaded from shortcuts not\nwith a working frontend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d90984a372f697dc2e0998278add23931596c0","amp;dn":"Classic+FPS+Collection+Ver.+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d90984a372f697dc2e0998278add23931596c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,217,9,132,163,114,246,151,220,46,9,152,39,138,221,35,147,21,150,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
