They found credibility as pioneers of rock/dance crossover, before moving on to international commercial success with &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot; and the Boss Drum 1992 album. [/quote]\n\n\n\n\n\nMove Any Mountain (single) 1991\n\n\n&quot;Move Any Mountain&quot; was a single performed by The Shamen. With a new radio remix by The Beatmasters, the song was released in the UK during the summer of 1991 and was their first top-ten single, reaching number three in the UK Singles Chart. It was the band's only top-40 hit in the U.S., where the song peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[1] The promotional video was filmed on the slopes of Mount Teide, Tenerife island where Will Sinnott drowned and died. This happened on 23 May 1991.\n\nIn response to demand for remixes from fans,[2] the band released the entire sample list and a number of remixes on the album Progeny, which at the time meant the single and album release of the track made it the only record to chart on both UK Singles and Album Charts at the same time.[3]\n\nIt is held that Japanese video game music producer Yuzo Koshiro made a remixed instrumental rendition of &quot;Move Any Mountain&quot; for the base-ball Stadium stage in Streets Of Rage 2.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\nMove Any Mountain [irp in the land of Oz mix]\nMove Any Mountain [landslide vox mix]\nMove Any Mountain [666 edit]\nMove Any Mountain [alta vista mix]\nMove Any Mountain [beatmasters dub mix]\nMove Any Mountain [mountains in the sky mix]\nMove Any Mountain [c mic]\nBass\nTrumpets\nGuitars\nKeyboards\nSax\nOz Loop\nBeltram Loop\nDevil Loop\nMAM Lo Vox\nMAM Hi Vox\nMAM Harmony\nMonkeys\nBang to the Beat Vox\nNo 1 Vox\nC Rap\nColin Rap\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a4c0bb7a4a782440de9c1f87b38f8eebdae45e","amp;dn":"Shamen+-+Move+any+Mountain+%28Single+%26+Samples%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0a4c0bb7a4a782440de9c1f87b38f8eebdae45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,164,192,187,122,74,120,36,64,222,156,31,135,179,143,142,235,218,228,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
