Yet with his unflappable spirit and boundless love, Boo has changed countless lives through his work as a therapy dog: helping a mute six-year-old boy to speak, coaxing movement from a paralyzed girl and stirring life in a ninety-four-year-old nun with Alzheimer's. But perhaps Boo's greatest miracle is the way he transformed Lisa Edwards's life, giving her the greatest gift of all: faith in herself.
