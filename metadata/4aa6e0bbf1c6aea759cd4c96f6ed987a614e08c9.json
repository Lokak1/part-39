This is some(all?) of the music from the Tanoshii Moomin Ikka TV show, also known as the Moomins or Mumin. The music is by Sumio Shiratori. There is Japanese vocals and talking.

It&amp;#039;s quite peaceful actually.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aa6e0bbf1c6aea759cd4c96f6ed987a614e08c9","amp;dn":"Tanoshii+Moomin+Ikka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aa6e0bbf1c6aea759cd4c96f6ed987a614e08c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,166,224,187,241,198,174,167,89,205,76,150,246,237,152,122,97,78,8,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
