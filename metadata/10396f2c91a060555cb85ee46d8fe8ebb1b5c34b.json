I have quite a few of them from salvaged machines.The hunt for the driver was a bitch since all the sites that supposed to have it was instead pushing a spyware driver updater program.I found the driver itself and posting it here for your use. It will work under Windows 7 in compatibility mode.The driver is normally for Win 9x and XP\n\nPlease seed after downloading","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10396f2c91a060555cb85ee46d8fe8ebb1b5c34b","amp;dn":"ALS+4000+sound+card+driver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10396f2c91a060555cb85ee46d8fe8ebb1b5c34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,57,111,44,145,160,96,85,92,184,94,228,109,143,232,235,177,181,195,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
