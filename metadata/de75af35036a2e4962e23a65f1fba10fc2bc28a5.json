Kassidy combines\ntraditional folk with a striking contemporary edge to create something\ntruly spectacular. The record kicks off in a flamboyantly loud fashion\nwith Stray Cat; a precursor of what one should expect for the rest of\nthe LP. Anthemic and powerful, the complexities of the production on\nthis track are visible. And this is obviously not forgetting the chants\nthat will stick in your head for hours. The hits keep coming with I\nDon't Know, an indie-americana track that has a very unusually\ncommercial edge to it. Soothing the psyche, this is sure to do\namazingly well across the boards. Aligning themselves with the Kings of\nLeon, The Lost is a steeplechase ride into folk touching on grungy\nrock. Again using folk traditions but adding a modern twist, makes this\na catchy track that not only captures your attention directly but\nprobably is one of the best tracks on the record.\n\nHowever, it is not all upbeat and boyant. That Old Song, a track that\nsounds like something from a Jimmy Cash back-catalogue, exemplifies\nsedated folk that is haunting and moody - even up to the final tragic\nnotes that linger on. Even Waking Up Sideways, as its title suggests,\nhas a hung-over and comatose feeling that allows it to stand apart from\nits peers. Similarly, Take Another Ride follows this poignant sound\nthat Kassidy are attempting to achieve; this hippy track is sure to go\ndown amazingly well in the summer festivals to come. Adding a level of\nintricacy to their music, Kassidy are able to combine beautifully\nproduced music with a sense of real longing or emotional fulfilment.\nThe album's title track captivates the senses with a real emotive and\ntouching pull. It's only regretful that the track doesn't last for\nlong.\n\nThe only problem that lies with this record is the lack of a huge\namount of new material. Consisting essentially of a collection of the\nthree EPs previously released, it probably would have been nicer to see\na larger variety of new material present on the record. But for new\nemerging fans, this really is the best of the best for Kassidy. Every\ntrack sounds different from the other, and you never reach the feeling\nof de-ja-vu on this record. Creating unique and enchanting music, this\nmay signify the birth of Kassidy as a force to be reckoned with.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/10/25/kassidy/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de75af35036a2e4962e23a65f1fba10fc2bc28a5","amp;dn":"Kassidy...Hope+St.%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de75af35036a2e4962e23a65f1fba10fc2bc28a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,117,175,53,3,106,46,73,98,226,58,101,241,251,161,15,194,188,40,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
