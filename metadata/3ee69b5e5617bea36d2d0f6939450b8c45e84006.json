Just put them into the Download folder and start the launcher then simply install!

The Tree of Prosperity cannot be harvested, so I also included the .package file, which fixes this issue! I heard some of you guys can't find it on tha intanetz, so you'll find it in it's own folder in this torrent. Enjoy guys, and don't forget to seed!! :)\n\nYou can find Lunar Lakes here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7039953/Sims_3_Neighborhood_-_Lunar_Lakes\n\n-admz0r-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ee69b5e5617bea36d2d0f6939450b8c45e84006","amp;dn":"The+Sims+3+Store-+February+2012-+Update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ee69b5e5617bea36d2d0f6939450b8c45e84006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,230,155,94,86,23,190,163,109,45,15,105,57,69,11,140,69,232,64,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
