The production is end to end brilliant, with Juice Crew guru Marley Marl soundtracking Kane through nine furious cuts (and one absolute stinker, the slow jam &quot;The Day You&amp;#039;re Mine&quot;). Marl&amp;#039;s production has rarely sounded finer, a gritty chorus of drums and funk-soul samples that have since been immortalized. &quot;Raw,&quot; &quot;Just Rhymin&amp;#039; with Biz,&quot; and &quot;Ain&amp;#039;t No Half-Steppin&amp;#039;&quot; are the certified anthems, but they&amp;#039;re not the only highlights. Check the furious &quot;Long Live the Kane&quot; and &quot;Set It Off&quot; for Kane&amp;#039;s up-tempo odes to himself. &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Take You There&quot; and &quot;Word to the Mother(Land)&quot; were the obligatory (yet heartfelt) Nation nods, mandatory during this brief late-&amp;#039;80s period of Afrocentricity. Though his image would soon switch to that of a smoothed-out new jack playa, the memory of Kane as one of hip-hop&amp;#039;s supreme lyrical rulers lives long on this masterpiece.\n\n1.
