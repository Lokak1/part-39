They seemed to sprout from the fire-harrowed soil like some iron harvest'. &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; is one of the greatest works to emerge from the catastrophe of the First World War. A memoir of astonishing power, savagery and ashen lyricism, it illuminates like no other book the horrors but also the fascination of total war, presenting the conflict through the eyes of an ordinary German soldier. As an account of the terrors of the Western Front and of the sickening allure that made men keep fighting on for four long years, &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; has no equal.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPirates, sharing is caring!
