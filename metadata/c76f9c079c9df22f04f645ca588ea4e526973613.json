They arrived in London and self-released their debut single &quot;Squares And Triangles&quot; in 1980. After their debut album they recruited The Soft Boys's bassist Matthew Seligman and New Zealand saxophonist Alannah Currie and their septet was in full gear with Joe Leeway. After they completed their third album John Roog and Peter Dodd left the group and formed the short lived act Big View as well as Matthew Seligman that went on as a session musician (for The Waterboys, David Bowie etc.) As a trio Thompson Twins reached their commercial peak with their &quot;Into The Gap&quot; album and the five singles that spawned, managing to conquer the american market as well. Joe Leeway went solo in 1986 and the group continued as a duo releasing three more albums. The band released eight albums in total. In 1993, Bailey and Currie started the electronic project Babble.\r\n\r\n[b]Thompson Twins â€Žâ€“ The Best Of Thompson Twins / Greatest Mixes\r\nGenre:[/b] Electronic\r\n[b]Style:[/b] Synth-pop\r\n[b]Year:[/b] 1988\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/m2aIEij.png[/img]\r\n\r\nExact Audio Copy V1.1 from 23.
