Adapted from the terrifying children's book by Neil Gaiman (author of the international sensation Sandman), this tale of menace and mayhem is set to music and lyrics by smart-rock iconoclast Stephin Merritt of The Magnetic Fields, and boasts a book by celebrated downtown actor/playwright, David Greenspan, who serves double-duty as the villainous Other Mother. Tony nominee Jayne Houdyshell (Well, The Receptionist) stars in the title role, and bringing it all together is acclaimed director Leigh Silverman (Yellowface, From Up Here, Well).\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:288be2bface8443cd323ad435d69abfc3ee47549","amp;dn":"Coraline+Off-Broadway+Cast+Recording+Neil+Gaiman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"288be2bface8443cd323ad435d69abfc3ee47549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,139,226,191,172,232,68,60,211,35,173,67,93,105,171,252,62,228,117,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
