The conference brought together a large group of outstanding scientists and engineers, who deal with various problems of dynamics encountered both in engineering and in daily life.\n\nTopics covered include, among others, bifurcations and chaos in mechanical systems; control in dynamical systems; asymptotic methods in nonlinear dynamics; stability of dynamical systems; lumped and continuous systems vibrations; original numerical methods of vibration analysis; and man-machine interactions.\n\nThus, the reader is given an overview of the most recent developments of dynamical systems and can follow the newest trends in this field of science. This book will be of interest to to pure and applied scientists working in the field of nonlinear dynamics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ebb4028d3f4f652d8e27e176c4a7f237176691d","amp;dn":"Modeling%2C+Simulation+and+Control+of+Nonlinear+Engineering+Dynami","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ebb4028d3f4f652d8e27e176c4a7f237176691d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,187,64,40,211,244,246,82,216,226,126,23,108,74,127,35,113,118,105,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
