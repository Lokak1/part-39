And when he failed to impress, whether on the football team, in math class, in the Navy or on the job, he simply gave up. A true tour-de-force, THE QUITTER is the universal tale of a young man's search for himself through the frustrations, redemptions and complexities of ordinary life. With gritty, atmospheric artwork by indie-comics luminary Dean Haspiel (American Splendor, Opposable Thumbs), THE QUITTER is both Pekar's funniest and most heart-wrenching work yet, an unforgettable graphic novel for all those, like Pekar, who have tried, failed and lived to quit another day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48fe9553ed3b947c9f5c0150de6cc76e55f4a397","amp;dn":"The+Quitter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48fe9553ed3b947c9f5c0150de6cc76e55f4a397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,254,149,83,237,59,148,124,159,92,1,80,222,108,199,110,85,244,163,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
