This book gives a detailed account of how Russia's two leading fighter aircraft designers competed for the order and how a third contender never made it to the hardware stage. It deals with the way these aircraft were conceived, designed, built, and flown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20dd565af8aa888bf7dfd30b0de63f67c3b786eb","amp;dn":"Sukhoi+S-37+%26+Mikoyan+MiG+MFI+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20dd565af8aa888bf7dfd30b0de63f67c3b786eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,221,86,90,248,170,136,139,247,223,211,11,13,230,63,103,195,183,134,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
