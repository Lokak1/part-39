But the tragedy was masked by an official lie, because while China was starving to death, the grain stores were full.\n\nBased on previously unheard testimony by survivors, rare archive footage, secret documents and interviews with the leading historians on this catastrophe, this film provides, for the first time, an insight into the folly of the The Great Leap Forward. \n\nIt examines the mechanisms and political decisions that led to famine, stripping away the incredible secrecy surrounding the campaign, and exposing the lie which continues even today as to who was responsible, and the true human cost. \n\nThe Great Leap ended in catastrophe, resulting in tens of millions of excess deaths. Estimates of the death toll range from 18 million to 45 million.\n\nHistorian Frank DikÃƒÂ¶tter asserts that &quot;coercion, terror, and systematic violence were the very foundation of the Great Leap Forward&quot; and it &quot;motivated one of the most deadly mass killings of human history.&quot;\n\nRelated Documentaries\n\n    The Great Leap Forward\n    China from the Inside\n    Chinas Bleak House\n\nMVG ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5157457ccf4c4f916e57ef2129e922e76fc9cc7f","amp;dn":"Mao%27s+Great+Famine+%282012%29+RTBF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5157457ccf4c4f916e57ef2129e922e76fc9cc7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,87,69,124,207,76,79,145,110,87,239,33,41,233,34,231,111,201,204,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
