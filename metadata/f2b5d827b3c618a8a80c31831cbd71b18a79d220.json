Studio Zoo is a lesson in why Faulkner needs to start playing against type; rather than swaddling every song in layers of delicately picked guitar, he should have found his inner wildebeest and let it roar. There's plenty of disquiet in the lyrics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Faulkner is forever fretting and apologising for his very existence, to the point of telling his girlfriend, on At the Seams: &quot;As if your life wasn't hard enough, you chose me.&quot; Had he stopped burying the emotions under passive-aggressive sweetness and let his voice ratchet up a few notches, this could have been an interesting album. The place to start would have been the aptly titled opener, Where to Start, in which JosÃƒÂ© GonzÃƒÂ¡lezish dream-pop strumming damps down the frustration of romantic disappointment. &quot;I'm tired of love, don't need nobody,&quot; he murmurs. Fine, now say it like you mean it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b5d827b3c618a8a80c31831cbd71b18a79d220","amp;dn":"Newton+Faulkner+-+Studio+Zoo+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b5d827b3c618a8a80c31831cbd71b18a79d220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,181,216,39,179,198,24,168,168,12,49,131,28,189,113,177,138,121,210,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
