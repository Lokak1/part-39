This series was written by Roger Stern, and drawn by Bob Hall and Brett Breeding.  This was followed by a 102-issue series (Volume 2) of the same name that ran from October 1985 to January 1994. This series was written by Steve Engelhart (with some fill-in issues covered by writers such as Mark Gruenwald) with art by Al Milgrom and Joe Sinnott. This creative team left as of issue 41, and from issue 42 to 57 the title was written and illustrated by John Byrne.  The title was renamed Avengers West Coast as of issue 47, in August, 1989.  From issue 58, the creative team varied, although writers Roy Thomas and Dann Thomas and artist Paul Ryan completed the majority of the run, with artist Dave Ross penciling the last several issues.  Volume 2 was accompanied by eight annuals, the first being published in 1986, the last in 1993.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fffb4b7720173e608c30d3ebdee0a85a2ac6363","amp;dn":"Avengers+West+Coast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fffb4b7720173e608c30d3ebdee0a85a2ac6363","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,255,180,183,114,1,115,230,8,195,13,62,189,238,10,133,162,172,99,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
