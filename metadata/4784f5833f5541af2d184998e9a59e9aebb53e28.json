When a tropical storm forces\nthem deep into the caverns, they must fight raging water, deadly terrain and\ncreeping panic as they search for an unknown escape route to the sea. Master diver\nFrank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) has explored the South Pacific's Esa-ala Caves\nfor months. But when his exit is cut off in a flash flood, Frank's team--including\n17-year-old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) and financier Carl Hurley\n(Ioan Gruffudd)--are forced to radically alter plans. With dwindling supplies, the\ncrew must navigate an underwater labyrinth to make it out.
