Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago and Stephen M. Walt of HarvardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s John F. Kennedy School of Government, was one of the most controversial articles in recent memory. Originally published in theLondon Review of Books in March 2006, it provoked both howls of outrage and cheers of gratitude for challenging what had been a taboo issue in America: the impact of the Israel lobby on U.S. foreign policy.\n\nNow in a work of major importance, Mearsheimer and Walt deepen and expand their argument and confront recent developments in Lebanon and Iran. They describe the remarkable level of material and diplomatic support that the United States provides to Israel and argues that this support cannot be fully explained on either strategic or moral grounds. This exceptional relationship is due largely to the political influence of a loose coalition of individuals and organizations that actively work to shape U.S. foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction. Mearsheimer and Walt provocatively contend that the lobby has a far-reaching impact on AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s posture throughout the Middle EastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, and toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflictÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the policies it has encouraged are in neither AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s national interest nor IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s long-term interest. The lobbyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence also affects AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship with important allies and increases dangers that all states face from global jihadist terror.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14505ca7a7b2a252275f8a5c5ae11f5bcbb0445a","amp;dn":"The+Israel+Lobby+And+U.S.+Foreign+Policy+-+John+J.+Mearsheimer+%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14505ca7a7b2a252275f8a5c5ae11f5bcbb0445a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,80,92,167,167,178,162,82,39,95,138,92,90,225,31,91,203,176,68,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
