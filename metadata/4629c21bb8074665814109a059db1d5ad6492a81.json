And so it is with Wolfgang Haffnerâ€™s Acoustic Shapes: as Haffner himself said, â€œIn a sense, the project appeared out of thin airâ€œ. Actually, Ida Sand was scheduled as opener for the Nils Landgren Funk Unit Tour 2007. She had to pull out, however, and Landgren asked his long-time drummer Wolfgang Haffner whether he could take over the spot. Haffner would have to come up with something new and fresh, but those who know him know that the most important German drummer of the younger generation wouldnâ€™t even think of repeating himself. Haffner has been searching for new challenges ever since he was discovered at the age of 18 by Germanyâ€™s most famous jazz musician, Albert Mangelsdorff, and immediately began playing in the legendary trombonistâ€™s band.
