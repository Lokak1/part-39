Recently a friend of mine stopped. Enjoyed (and relayed on) his compilations (Dutch Treat) the last 20 months. Got lazy myself. So I felt this should continue. So I volunteered.\n\nListening to the multiple Indie Rock lists, it did not take me long to understand why. 80% is - with respect - shit. Interested listeners deserve better. And even more important it keeps new (older) listeners from getting interested and learn to enjoy some new sounds (the next 40 years).\n\nIndie is no Punk (against), Indie has history (Sixties) and history tells a story (together). So I will try to be that arrogant to select only the best tracks (Sound wise and Content wise, taste wise?) for my guests.\n\nThe best way to start (and the best way to learn things) was making a first Upload under my own name (~@~). I have chosen for six Dutch Treat compilations that helped me to enjoy the Music of today. And a bit of a thank you of course.\n\nEnjoy sharing.... Nice and load, and play along with Porcupine Tree, Fink, Mother Mother and others.\n\n\n6 Reasons to listen to Indie (Folk,Pop,Rock MP3)\n\n_B024 Desert Sunrise (Brett Dennen)\n\n01 - Make The Most\n02 - There Is So Much More\n03 - So Far From Me\n04 - When I Go\n05 - Must Be Losing My Mind\n06 - Sydney (I'll Come Running)\n07 - Desert Sunrise\n08 - Because You Are A Woman\n09 - Just Like The Moon\n10 - By &amp; By\n11 - Ain't No Reason\n12 - She's Mine\n13 - Darlin' Do Not Fear\n14 - The One Who Loves You The Most\n15 - Can't Slow Down\n16 - Fig Tree\n17 - All We Have\n\n_B025 Stars Die (Porcupine Tree)\n\n101 - Drawing The Line\n102 - This Is No Rehearsal\n103 - Ambulance Chasing\n104 - Shesmovedon\n105 - Time Flies\n106 - Waiting-Phase One\n107 - Drown With Me\n108 - Stop Swimming\n109 - The Moon Touches Your Shoulder\n110 - I Drive The Hearse\n111 - Chloroform\n112 - Anesthetize\n201 - Lightbulb Sun\n202 - The Rest Will Flow\n203 - Disappear\n204 - Stars Die\n205 - Dark Matter\n206 - Buying New Soul\n207 - Trains\n208 - Lazarus\n209 - Blackest Eyes\n210 - Prodigal\n211 - Heartattack In A Layby\n212 - Russia On Ice\n213 - Radioactive Toy\n214 - Halo\n215 - Open Car\n\n_B027 Tiny Tears (Tindersticks)\n\n01 - Ballad Of Tindersticks\n02 - Come Inside\n03 - Factory Girls\n04 - I Want You\n05 - Medicine\n06 - Peanuts\n07 - Sometimes It Hurts\n08 - Tiny Tears\n09 - Can Our Love...\n10 - Desperate Man\n\n_B028 Soldier (Angus &amp; Julia Stone)\n\n01 - Mango Tree\n02 - Here We Go Again\n03 - Bird On The Buffalo\n04 - What You Wanted\n05 - Paper Aeroplane\n06 - Big Jet Plane\n07 - Private Lawns\n08 - Soldier\n09 - Say It Right\n10 - Stranger\n11 - Yellow Brick Road\n12 - For You\n13 - Draw Your Swords\n14 - And The Boys\n15 - Babylon\n16 - The Beast\n17 - Bella\n18 - Hush\n19 - A Book Like This\n20 - The Devil's Tears\n21 - Jewels And Gold\n22 - All Of Me\n23 - Just A Boy\n24 - Silver Coin\n25 - Horse And Cart\n\n_B037 Bit By Bit (Mother Mother)\n\n01 - Love It Dissipates\n02 - Little Pistol\n03 - Ball Cap\n04 - Dirty Town\n05 - Bit By Bit\n06 - The Stand\n07 - Miles\n08 - Little Hands\n09 - Verbatim\n10 - Love And Truth\n11 - Original Spin\n12 - Angry Sea\n13 - Oh Ana\n14 - Chasing It Down\n15 - Waiting For The World To End\n16 - Business Man\n17 - Train Of Thought\n18 - Polynesia\n19 - Neighbour\n20 - Wrecking Ball\n21 - Let's Fall In Love\n22 - Dread In My Heart\n23 - Infinitesimal\n24 - Body Of Yours\n25 - Hay Loft\n26 - Tic Toc\n27 - Calm Me Down\n28 - Had It All\n29 - Touch Up\n30 - Sleep Awake\n\n_B038 Get Your Share (Fink)\n\n01 - All Cried Out\n02 - If Only\n03 - Blueberry Pancakes\n04 - Pigtails\n05 - Warm Shadow\n06 - This Is The Thing\n07 - Pretty Little Thing\n08 - Get Your Share\n09 - Little Blue Mailbox\n10 - Maker\n11 - Biscuits For Breakfast\n12 - Six Weeks\n13 - So Long\n14 - Pills In My Pockets\n15 - Trouble's What You're In\n16 - Make It Good\n17 - Walking In The Sun\n18 - Sort Of Revolution\n19 - Q &amp; A\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82424f05680b86be216b4f18c75aaad074c679d7","amp;dn":"%7E%40%7E+Indie+for+Oldies+%28Porcupine+Tree%2C+Fink%2C+Mother+Mother+a.o.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82424f05680b86be216b4f18c75aaad074c679d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,66,79,5,104,11,134,190,33,107,79,24,199,90,170,208,116,198,121,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
