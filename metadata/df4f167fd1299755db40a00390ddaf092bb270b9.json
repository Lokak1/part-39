All are digitally re-mastered, with rare and previously unreleased bonus material supplementing each release.\n\n\nGreen River (40th Anniversary Edition)\n\nWritten by El Bicho\n\n\nIn honor of the 40th anniversary of their debut album, Fantasy Records is releasing the six studio albums of the band as a quartet. No word yet of their final album, Mardi Gras, which found lead guitarist John Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford as a trio after rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty quit.\n\nJohn must have been on fire creatively because in March 1969, weeks after Bayou Country, they released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad Moon RisingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLodiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the flipside, two CCR classics with the former arguably being their definitive and most well-known song. In August of that same year, Green River was released. If Bayou County is where they found their distinctive sound, Green River is where they perfected it. The only flaw is its length, coming in at 28-plus minutes, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fair trade off for such a quick turnaround of such strong material.\n\nA surefire way to get yourself back to the bayou is to travel down ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreen River.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s swamp boogie guitar on the title track that opens the album lets you know your heading in the right direction to get ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œback down where cool water flows, yeah.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The reason the narrator needs to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œremember things I loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is because many of the songs on the album are filled with gloom and doom and in his youth he was given sage advice from Old Cody Jr. that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œif you get lost come on home to green river.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOne reason to feel lost is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCommotionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of life. The band rips through this one at an up-tempo pace, reflecting the hectic nature of life as people are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhurryin' to getÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where there going. However, a commotion can be raised by someone not even moving, such as those who ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkeep a-talkin', they don't say a word,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ yet that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop them as they ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ including those in the White House, one of JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first songwriting slights at those in charge.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTombstone ShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is another spooky blues number in the vein of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGraveyard Train.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This time a gypsy man, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œway down in san berdoo/ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Said I got thirteen months of bad luck.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar has a great tone that rings out. On the second bridge, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fantastic, creepy-sounding guitar duet.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWrote A Song For EveryoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a little bit country as John writes a song for those that need to be remembered: those in the welfare line, those goinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ down to war, those in jail fighting for whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right. This is one of the many songs that show how the talented the rest of the band was as they are create music that matches whatever genre the song resembled.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad Moon RisingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is about the end of the world as he knows it and the band sounds fine. Never has impending Armageddon sounded so good with JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost joyful delivery backed by a foot-tapping, hand-clapping beat. They might have the right idea. ShouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t we all be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œquite prepared to dieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ since death is part of the price of admission in this crazy thing we call life? If you have to deal with earthquakes and lighting, hurricanes and floods, better to do it with a smile on your face and a spring in your step.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLodiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tells the tale of so many who ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œset out on the road,/ Seeking my fame and fortune,/ Looking for a pot of gold.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s especially poignant for the musician who, in contrast to what they hear from their friends or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe man from the magazine,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ comes up short on talent or luck, seeing their one-night stand last seven months and their dreams turn to home.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCross-Tie WalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a riff similar to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad Moon RisingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and continues JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fascination with trains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSinister PurposeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ finds the Devil offering a deal to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMake you rich and wiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the music is wonderfully evocative and menacing.\n\nThe album proper closes with the only cover ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Night Is The Right Time.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ First recorded in 1937 by Roosevelt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe HoneydripperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sykes then a year later by Big Bill Broonzy. The definitive version for me is Ray CharlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ version from 1958 where Margie Hendricks joined him. CCR do a fine job, but it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit the mood or themes of the album.\n\nProbably do to its short length, Green River offers the most bonus tracks of the re-issues. Two unfinished songs feature only the music. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBroken Spoke ShuffleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has serious country western twang. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGlory BeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a British Invasion sound and Stu standouts on bass like never before, offering up some funky lines that make you wish he had been allowed to do this more often.\n\nThe three live tracks are from the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final concert swing through Europe as a trio in 1971. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad Moon RisingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Berlin, Germany is played in their typical ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œslightly faster liveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pace. JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals are micÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d well, but his guitar sounds out of tune and over amplified so you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make anything else out but the drums. In this performance, some of the joy is missing and is replaced with trepidation.\n\nThe melding of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreen River/ Suzie QÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ shows how close the music. In fact, the transition is seamless. The audio quality is much better in its presentation of the whole band, likely due to this performance being recorded for but cut from Live in Europe.\n\n\nWhile the audio quality of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLodiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Hamburg, Germany doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sound good, the bad recording actually adds to the song. The poor-sounding performance helps to exemplify why the narrator is stuck in Lodi, and sounds like an AM radio station having trouble picking up a signal.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t rest on their laurels as they toured, including joining the world at Woodstock, and released Willie and the Poor Boys this same year in November.\n\n\n\n\n\n01 Green River\n02 Commotion\n03 Tombstone Shadow\n04 Wrote a Song for Everyone\n05 Bad Moon Rising\n06 Lodi\n07 Cross-Tie Walker\n08 Sinister Purpose\n09 The Night Time Is the Right Time\n10 Broken Spoke Shuffle (Wally Heider session) [bonus track]\n11 Glory Be (Wally Heider session) [bonus track]\n12 Bad Moon Rising (Live in Berlin, 9/16/71) [bonus track]\n13 Green River/Suzie Q (Live in Stockholm, 9/21/71) [bonus track]\n14 Lodi (Live in Hamburg, 9/17/71) [bonus track]\n\n\n\n    * John Fogerty - lead vocals, lead guitar, harmonica, keyboards, saxophone\n    * Tom Fogerty - rhythm guitar, backing vocals, piano\n    * Stu Cook - bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards\n    * Doug Clifford - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df4f167fd1299755db40a00390ddaf092bb270b9","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival-Green+River%281969%29%282008+Concorde+Rem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df4f167fd1299755db40a00390ddaf092bb270b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,79,22,127,209,41,151,85,219,64,160,3,144,221,175,9,43,178,112,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
