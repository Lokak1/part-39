She has always been influenced a bit by jazz, and this 1997 release was her first full jazz recording. Callaway has a haunting voice and, as with most cabaret singers, a great respect for the lyrics she interprets; her singing on &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; is a bit eerie. Pianist Kenny Barron, Bob Mintzer on tenor and soprano, and trumpeter Randy Brecker all get a generous amount of solo space, while bassist Jay Leonhart and percussionist George Jinda are fine in support; considering the high quality of her sidemen, it is a major compliment to the singer to say that her vocals do not cause the set to sag or the listener to lose his interest. On &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;Old Devil Moon&quot; in particular, she shows the potential of becoming a significant jazz singer in the future if she sticks to this path. Strangely enough, an intriguing original blues (clocking in around four-and-a-half minutes) is included at the end of the program, but not mentioned on the back cover or in the liners. Recommended.
