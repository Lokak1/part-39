The series' first arc is chronologically the earliest story told in the new universe, set a short time before the events of Justice League's first arc, which itself is set five years in the past. It features a younger Superman who, after the loss of his adoptive parents, moves to Metropolis. There, despite social stigmata towards superheroes, let alone aliens, he rises to the challenge of becoming the city's champion.\n\n-Most of the information above is from Comicvine.\n\n-----------\n\nThis torrent contains Grant Morrison's complete Action Comics run. I have ordered the issues in this run in what I think is a good order to read the run, by no means do I claim it to be the correct order to read the run. The annual and the back ups ar written by Sholly Fisch. I have put the backup for issue 0 after issue 12 as it features the antagonist of issue 12. I have also left a read me with the order the issues were released. I hope you all enjoy and let me know if there's something wrong with the torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425e9d87abf948f4110dda1cbf786909fb4cbac3","amp;dn":"Morrison%27s+Action+Comics+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425e9d87abf948f4110dda1cbf786909fb4cbac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,94,157,135,171,249,72,244,17,13,218,28,191,120,105,9,251,76,186,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
