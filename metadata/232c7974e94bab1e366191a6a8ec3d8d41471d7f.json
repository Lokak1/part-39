Their introduction has been slow and subtle, and even now not much is known about them. The conclusion of the previous issue saw the beginning of the first major confrontation between our heroes and these new villains, and the newest issue sees the fallout of this. The result is certainly unexpected, but in the end, the newest issueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest selling point is what happens to Carl Grimes.\n\nNope. No spoilers here, folks, but the most surprising thing about this issue is the new chapter that suddenly unfolds for one of the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular characters. For the last few issues, Kirkman has been directing our attention to The Whisperers, who seem to be people who camouflage themselves with zombie-cosplay. While there is certainly forward momentum with them here, so far they continue to be a bit underwhelming. Knowing Kirkman though, this is by design as they might become interesting in a different way. For now though the biggest development involves surprising shift in focus to Carl. After so many years of surviving in a hostile world, can any of these survivors truly form the peaceful society that has been painted for us in the recent run of issues? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the question thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brought up in this issue, and it looks like Carl is the going to be the subject of this analysis in the issues ahead.\n\nCharlie Adlard must consider drawing these characters second nature at this point considering that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been doing this for so many years. However, that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t capable of surprising his fans with his incredible acting skills. Once again, the focus here is on CarlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scenes which shine through with a vicious intensity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:232c7974e94bab1e366191a6a8ec3d8d41471d7f","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+134+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"232c7974e94bab1e366191a6a8ec3d8d41471d7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,44,121,116,233,75,171,30,54,97,145,166,168,236,61,141,65,71,29,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
