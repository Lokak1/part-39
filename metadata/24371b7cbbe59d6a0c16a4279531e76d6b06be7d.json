Dark Horse takes no responsibility for bodily injuries sustained while reading The Moth #1. The unbridled action spilling from the pages are an understandable consequence of teaming (penciler) Steve Rude, and (writer/ inker) Gary Martin together. So if you get punched in the eye because you're holding this comic too close, don't come crying to us! In this issue, The Moth runs smack into the face of trouble, in the form of his archrival, Nestor the bounty hunter. Check out the picture of Nestor, in the dictionary definition of the word scum!
