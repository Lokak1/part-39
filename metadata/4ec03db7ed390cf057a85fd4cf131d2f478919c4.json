It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, and reading as a method of stress management or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, and is often associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality. The harmonies in new-age music are generally modal, consonant, or include a drone bass, and are often structured as variations on a theme. \n\n                New-age artists range from solo or ensemble performances using classical-music instruments ranging from the piano, acoustic guitar, flute or harp to electronic musical instruments, or from Eastern instruments such as the sitar, tabla, and tamboura. There is a significant overlap of sectors of new-age music, ambient music, classical music, jazz, electronica, world music, chillout, space music and others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ec03db7ed390cf057a85fd4cf131d2f478919c4","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+577","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ec03db7ed390cf057a85fd4cf131d2f478919c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,192,61,183,237,57,12,240,87,168,95,212,207,19,29,47,71,137,25,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
