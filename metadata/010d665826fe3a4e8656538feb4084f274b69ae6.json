Smith and singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, among others. It was preceded by the lead single, &quot;Fight for This Love&quot;, which became the fastest-selling single of 2009 in the UK. It charted at number one on both the Irish and UK Singles Chart. The album entered at the top spot of the UK Albums Chart. On 6 November 2009 the British Phonographic Industry certified the album Platinum denoting shipments 300,000 units.\n\nAmazon.com - Debut solo album from the Girls Aloud singer, who has risen to even greater popularity following her stint as a judge on The X Factor. As opposed to the electro direction of Girls Aloud's recent work, this album has a distinct RnB influence due largely to the production contributions of will.i.am and Taio Cruz. A host of faces from the worlds of pop and dance were also involved, the striking cover portrait was shot by renowned fashion photographer Nick Knight, and the singles &quot;Fight For This Love&quot; and &quot;3 Words&quot; is included.\n\nAs a bonus i have downloaded Cheryl ColeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s web page content, which includes 2 desktop wallpapers and 10 Videos of  Cheryl talking about each song on the album. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] 3 Words\tCheryl Cole Featuring Will.I.Am\n[02] Parachute\n[03] Heaven\tCheryl Cole Featuring Will.I.Am\n[04] Fight For This Love\n[05] Rain On Me\n[06] Make Me Cry\n[07] Happy Hour\n[08] Stand Up\n[09] Don't Talk About This Love\n[10] Boy Like You\tCheryl Cole Featuring Will.I.Am\n[11] Heartbreaker\tWill.I.Am Featuring Cheryl Cole\n\nMovie Videos Downloaded From Web CD Access Area\n\n[01] Cheryl Cole Talks About - 3 Words\n[02] Cheryl Cole Talks About - Parachute\n[03] Cheryl Cole Talks About - Heaven\n[04] Cheryl Cole Talks About ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fight For This Love\n[05] Cheryl Cole Talks About ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rain On Me\n[06] Cheryl Cole Talks About ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Make Me Cry\n[07] Cheryl Cole Talks About ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Happy Hour\n[08] Cheryl Cole Talks About ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stand Up\n[09] Cheryl Cole Talks About ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Talk About This Love\n[10] Cheryl Cole Talks About ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Boy Like You\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:43m:58s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 327mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v9.0.2.25 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Quicktime\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop \nRelease Date\t&gt; 23 October 2009\nRecord Company\t&gt; Polydor\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.cherylcole.com \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Cole \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/c/cherylcole.html \n\t&gt;\t&gt; http://www.bebo.com/cherylcolemusic \n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/cherylcole \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;[3 Words]\n\t&gt;[Fight For This Love]\n\t&gt;[Heartbreaker]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:010d665826fe3a4e8656538feb4084f274b69ae6","amp;dn":"%5B2009%5D+3+Words+-+Cheryl+Cole+327mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"010d665826fe3a4e8656538feb4084f274b69ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,13,102,88,38,254,58,78,134,86,83,143,235,64,132,242,116,182,154,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
