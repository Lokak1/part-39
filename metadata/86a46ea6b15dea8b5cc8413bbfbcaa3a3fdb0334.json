When Mooney's rich, slightly quavering voice then starts singing about heading down by the levee, &quot;on sacred ground,&quot; you just know he means it. This song is powered one hundred percent by that unique sweet New Orleans steam. And that's just the beginning.\nMooney sings in a rough baritone and plays stunning acoustic steel guitar, electric slide, or his own self-made &quot;swamp box,&quot; which sounds as down-home as the name suggests. The other musicians, most of them from Mooney's working band, are just as fine, with drummer George C. Recile a regular second line in his own right. The album is loose-limbed, energetic, swampy, and as smoky and sweet as good barbecue\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Sacred Gound 5:08\n2. Doggone Thing 3:45\n3. Sweat'n Bones 3:51\n4. Broken Mold 2:42\n5.
