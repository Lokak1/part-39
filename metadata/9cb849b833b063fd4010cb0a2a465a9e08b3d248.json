After hooking back up with the Grateful Dead in the mid-'70s, Hart began incorporating advanced time-signatures into the &quot;Drums&quot; portion of the &quot;Rhythm Devils&quot; duets with Bill Kreutzmann (drums). As described in the liner notes, this is something of a soundtrack album for a planet called DÃƒÂ¤fos (1985). Hart (tar/beam/stick/tubular bells/percussion/berimbaus/saron/vocals) is accompanied by Steve Douglas (woodwinds), Shabda Khan (tar), Jody Diamond (saron), Bobby Vega (bass), Flora Purim (vocals), Airto Moreira (percussion) and the Brazilian group Batucaje among others for a collection of ambient soundscapes adorned by an array of indigenous hand and mallet-struck percussion. Although dominated by instruments, Flora Purim's vocals during &quot;Reunion I&quot; through &quot;Reunion III&quot; are equally as expressive as Vega's propulsive electric bass interjections, backed by Hart and Moreira's perpetual pursuit. &quot;SaudaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular&quot; is one of the cuts to feature Batucaje, who join Hart on berimbau. The instrument's wah-wah effect is produced by the bow-like object that is struck, while the frequency is controlled by the amount of pressure the player places when moving it against the body. The mid-tempo tune incrementally increases in speed to match the intensity of the participants fervor. &quot;Psychopomp&quot; is Hart providing ambience on the amplified piano-string Beam -- that was often the highlight of the Grateful Dead's &quot;Space&quot; jams. The hollow, almost metallic &quot;Subterranean Caves of Kronos&quot; is once again just Hart on a series of subdued melodic tubular bell progressions. Conversely cacophonous is the multi-drum Beast, a 25-foot round aluminum frame able to support a capacious assemblage of drums. Its use became another zenith of Grateful Dead shows and Hart gives it a workout on the hell-bound &quot;Gates of DÃƒÂ¤fos.&quot; According to the brief text supplied for each song title, the lengthy &quot;Passage&quot; depicts the journey once inside the Gates of DÃƒÂ¤fos, which develops from the atmosphere of a pastoral setting to the urban sounds of sambas and celebrations. Upon its release, DÃƒÂ¤fos (1985) garnered substantial notice from audiophiles, including a write-up in Absolute Sound that is reprinted in the Rykodisc CD edition. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb849b833b063fd4010cb0a2a465a9e08b3d248","amp;dn":"Mickey+Hart%2C+Airto%2C+Flora+Purim+-+Dafos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb849b833b063fd4010cb0a2a465a9e08b3d248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,184,73,184,51,176,99,253,64,16,203,10,42,70,90,158,8,179,210,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
