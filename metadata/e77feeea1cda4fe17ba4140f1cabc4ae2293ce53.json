But there is two problem, i have not enough space in my room to do this, and i have not enough money either (Not even close in next several years)\nTill that day when IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have enough money and enough space, I would be satisfied with electronic bibliography of Stephen King that I collect in last several days, and of course movies that I already watched and download (and will) from thePiratebay. \nIt take a lot of my time to find all this books, and after that convert them from stupid .LITS and Microsoft Word to .PDF. So, all books are in PDF! (Except Roadwork from 1981. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t succeed to convert from LIT to PDF, but still the book is readable with Microsoft Reader, SalemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Lot from 2004 is in LIT and PDF,format, but LIT is much more readable than other one). Leave a comment if anyone manage to convert properly these books. If those books are not converted good, (I checked each one, and they are good converted) in a case if you still want to make some changes, like formatting the text and make books more tidy, so you can print, read or edit,  I recommend strongly to use Foxit not Adobe, or Solid PDF converter, only for converting.\nCollection is divided by years, from 1974, and his first novel Carrie, till 2008, and last story collection Just After Sunset. Some years are empty, because King didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t published his works that years (exactly 1975, 1997 and 2000). Collection has 64 Novels, 8 Story Collections and 104 Stories. Well, it is not because I collected it, but this is amazing collection (or bibliography) of Stephen King, as I like to say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢A most complete collection of Stephen KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s books on internetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. ATTENTION!!! Two books I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find complete, these are Blaze and Colorado Kid, they have only beginning parts (first one have first two chapters, and second one have first 50 pages) and I beg anyone who have these books to share with other members, so we can have totally complete collection. I must admit that I am very jealous on all those people who know English very well, I hope I will improve mine with Stephen King. \n\n\n-----------------------------1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s-----------------------------------------------\n\n1974\nStephen King - Carrie  (1974)\nStephen King - &amp;#039;Salem&amp;#039;s Lot (1974)\n\n1975\n\n1976\nKing, Stephen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rage\nStephen King - The Shining (1976)\n\n1977\nShort Stories:\nNight Shift ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Foreward\nStephen King - Night Shift ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Battleground\nStephen King - Night Shift - Children of the Corn\nStephen King - Night Shift - Graveyard Shift\nStephen King - Night Shift - Grey Matter\nStephen King - Night Shift - I Am The Doorway\nStephen King - Night Shift - I Know What You Need\nStephen King - Night Shift - Jerusalems Lot\nStephen King - Night Shift - Night Surf\nStephen King - Night Shift - One For The Road\nStephen King - Night Shift ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Quitters\nStephen King - Night Shift - Sometimes They Come Back\nStephen King - Night Shift - Strawberry Spring\nStephen King - Night Shift - The Boogeyman\nStephen King - Night Shift - The Last Rung On The Ladder\nStephen King - Night Shift - The Lawnmower Man\nStephen King - Night Shift - The Ledge\nStephen King - Night Shift - The Man Who Loved Flowers\nStephen King - Night Shift - The Mangler\nStephen King - Night Shift - The Woman In The Room\nStephen King - Night Shift - Trucks\nStory Collection:\nKing, Stephen - Night Shift\n\n1978\nKing, Stephen - The Long Walk\n\n1979\nKing, Stephen - Danse Macabre\nStephen King - The Dead Zone (1979)\n\n----------------------------1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s------------------------------------------------\n\n1980\nKing, Stephen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Roadwork\nStephen King - Firestarter (1980)\n\n1981\nBachman Books 4- Running Man\nCujo\nThe Darktower 1 - The Gunslinger\nShort Stories:\nApt Pupil\nRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\nThe Body\nThe Breathing Method\nStory Collection:\nDifferent Seasons\n\n1982\nPet Sematary\nPlant (Installment One)\nPlant (Installment Two)\n\n1983\nKing, Stephen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Christine\n\n1984\nPlant (Installment Three)\nStephen King - The Talisman (1984)\nThinner\nShort Stories:\nBeachworld\nBig Wheels - A Tale of the Laundry Game\nCain Rose Up\nFor Owen\nGramma\nHere There Be Tygers\nMorning Deliveries\nMrs. Todd&amp;#039;s Shortcut\nNona\nParanoid - A Chant\nSurvivor Type\nThe Ballad of the Flexible Bullet\nThe Jaunt\nThe Man Who Would Not Shake Hands\nThe Mist\nThe Monkey\nThe Reach\nThe Reaper&amp;#039;s Image\nThe Wedding Gig\nUncle Otto&amp;#039;s Truck\nWord Processor of the Gods\n\n1985\nStephen King - Cycle of the Werewolf (1985)\nStephen King - The Bachman Books (1985)\nStory Collection:\nStephen King - Skeleton Crew (1985)\n\n\n1986\nKing, Stephen - The Dark Tower 02 - The Drawing of the Three\nStephen King - It (1986)\n\n1987\nStephen King - Eyes Of The Dragon (1987)\nStephen King - Misery (1987)\nThe TommyKnockers\n\n1988\nKing, Stephen - Dolan&amp;#039;s Cadillac\n\n1989\nStephen King - The Dark Half (1989)\nStephen King - The Stand (Unabridged) (1989)\nShort Stories:\nFour Past Midnight - 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Introduction\nFour Past Midnight - 2 - The Langoliers\nFour Past Midnight - 3 - Secret Window, Secret Garden\nFour Past Midnight - 4 - The Sun Dog\nFour Past Midnight - 5 - The Library Policeman\n\n-----------------------------1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s-----------------------------------------------\n\n1990\nStephen King - Needful Things (1990)\nKing, Stephen - The Dark Tower 03 - The Waste Lands\nStory Collection:\nFour Past Midnight\n\n1991\nStephen King - Gerald&amp;#039;s Game (1992)\n\n1992\nDolores Clairborne\nShort Stories:\nBrooklyn August\nCrouch End\nHead Down\nHome Delivery\nIt Grows on You\nKing, Stephen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dedication\nKing, Stephen - Dolan&amp;#039;s Cadillac\nKing, Stephen - My Pretty Pony\nKing, Stephen - Suffer the Little Children\nKing, Stephen - Umney&amp;#039;s Last Case\nMy Pretty Pony\nPopsy\nRainy Season\nSneakers\nSorry, Right Number\nThe Doctor&amp;#039;s Case\nThe End of the Whole Mess\nThe Fifth Quarter\nThe House on Maple Street\nThe Moving Finger\nThe Night Flier\nThe Ten O &amp;#039;Clock People\nYou Know They Got a Hell of a Band\n\n1993\nStephen King - Insomnia (1993)\nStory Collection:\nStephen King - Nightmares and Dreamscapes (1993)\n\n1994\nStephen King - Rose Madder (1995)\n\n1995\nKing, Stephen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Desperation\nThe Regulators\n\n1996\nKing, Stephen - Six Stories - Ltd.
