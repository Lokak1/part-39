When higher education is expected to promote complex achievements in subject disciplines and in terms of 'employability', problems arise: how are such achievements to be assessed?\n\n In the first part of the book, it is argued that existing grading practices cannot cope with the expectations laid upon them, while the potential of formative assessment for the support of learning is not fully realised. The authors argue that improving the effectiveness of assessment depends on a well-grounded appreciation of what assessment is, and what may and may not be expected of it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:387ad22e88e96797374aa13421c7fc785e2a80db","amp;dn":"Assessment+Learning+and+Employability","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"387ad22e88e96797374aa13421c7fc785e2a80db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,122,210,46,136,233,103,151,55,74,161,52,33,199,252,120,94,42,128,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
