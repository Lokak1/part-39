Jang, who once studied at Taipei's Chinese Culture University under Yo-Yo Ma's father, now resides in the States and composes music unadorned with any noticeable cultural influences. Her 14 piano solos, pieces that had their origin as bedtime confections for her young children, are almost uniformly quiet, reflective, earnestly melodic, and easily digested. Jang perfumes her impressionistic compositions with a gentle spirit that endows them with an essence of instant familiarity; though to her credit, her musical structures convey an intelligence that elevates these pieces a notch above typical lullaby fare. In Jang's world, your dreams will be sweet, not sugar-coated.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/ [/url] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:950ac2e57bfab5c5c1557582b7fb60c3cd8cae1a","amp;dn":"Mia+Jang...Sweet+Dreams%281998%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"950ac2e57bfab5c5c1557582b7fb60c3cd8cae1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,10,194,229,123,250,181,197,193,85,117,130,183,251,96,195,205,140,174,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
