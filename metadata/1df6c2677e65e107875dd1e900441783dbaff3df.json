This much-needed set contrarily concentrates on the latter part of his hitmaking career and the ones that got away -- singles that were solid chart performers at the time but tend to be overlooked by other collections. The most authentic of Shaky's rock &amp; roll stylings, &quot;Hot Dog&quot; (his first U.K. hit from 1980), opens the set, but then it's solid late-'80s as the Dave Edmunds-produced &quot;Lipstick Powder and Paint&quot; peels off the 1985 album of the same name to usher in such half-forgotten jewels as &quot;Turning Away,&quot; &quot;A Little Boogie Woogie in the Back of My Mind,&quot; &quot;Come See About Me,&quot; and so on. It's lightweight popabilly fare at best, and there's no doubting that Shaky was going off the musical boil a lot faster than he was slipping down the commercial listings. But two major smashes, the festive &quot;Merry Christmas Everyone&quot; and &quot;What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For,&quot; his final U.K. Top Five hit in 1987, do make the grade, while the best numbers on Hit Collection Edition are the ones that don't ring a bell until you hear them -- and then you wonder how you could ever have let them slip!
