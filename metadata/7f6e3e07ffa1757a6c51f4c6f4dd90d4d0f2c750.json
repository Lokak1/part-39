This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThis is the first time in chart history the a new act (England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley) has had both of their first two songs on the chart at the same time.\n\nFirefall also has their first hit.\n\nOne singer in the countdown couldn't get any success recording original songs, but after she switched to doing remakes, her carreer took off. Casey gives the details.\n\nYou'll never guess which song in the top 10 has spent eighteen weeks in the top 40.\n\nCasey tells a great story about an artist in this countdown who started 1976, $250,000 in debt, and stood to gross $50 million by the end of that year.\n\nThis is one of several broadcasts where Casey recounts the life of the world's first disc jockey, Al Jarvis.\n\nTwo segments contain only bumber music. We have people here who drink.\n\n40: Give It Up, Turn It Loose - Tyrone Davis\n39: Getaway - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n38: Anything You Want - John Valenti\n37: Nights Are Forever Without You - England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n36: Nice 'N' Nasty - Salsoul Orchestra\n35: You Don't Have To Be A Star - Marilyn McCoo &amp; Billy Davis Jr.\n34: I Never Cry - Alice Cooper\n33: I'd Really Love To See You Tonight - England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n32: Devil Woman - Cliff Richard\n31: Did You Boogie With Your Baby - Flash Cadillac &amp; The Continental Kids\n30: You Are My Starship - Norman Connors\n29: This One's For You - Barry Manilow\n28: A Dose Of Rock And Roll - Ringo Starr\n27: A Little Bit More - Dr. Hook\n26: Still The One - Orleans\n25: Lowdown - Boz Scaggs\n24: Do You Feel Like We Do - Peter Frampton\n23: The Best Disco In Town - The Ritchie Family\n22: Tonight's The Night - Rod Stewart\n21: The Rubberband Man - Spinners\n20: You Are The Woman - Firefall\n19: More Than A Feeling - Boston\n18: Fernando - Abba\n17: Just To Be Close To You - Commodores\n16: Nadia's Theme - Barry Devoreaux &amp; Perry Botkin, Jr.\nExtra: Frankenstein - Edgar Winter Group (Not rebroadcast)\n15: Beth - Kiss\n14: Don't Fear The Reaper - Blue Oyster Cult\n13: Shake Your Booty - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n12: I Only Want To Be With You - Bay City Rollers\n11: That'll Be The Day - Linda Ronstadt\n10: Magic Man - Heart\n9: Muskrat Love - The Captain And Tennille\n8: Play That Funky Music - Wild Cherry\n7: She's Gone - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n6: Love So Right - Bee Gees\n5: A Fifth Of Beethoven - Walter Murphy\n4: The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald - Gordon Lightfoot\n3: Rockin' Me - Steve Miller Band\nExtra: Monster Mash - Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett\n2: Disco Duck - Rick Dees\n1: If You Leave Me Now - Chicago\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f6e3e07ffa1757a6c51f4c6f4dd90d4d0f2c750","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1976_October_30th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f6e3e07ffa1757a6c51f4c6f4dd90d4d0f2c750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,110,62,7,255,161,117,122,108,81,244,198,244,221,144,212,208,242,199,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
