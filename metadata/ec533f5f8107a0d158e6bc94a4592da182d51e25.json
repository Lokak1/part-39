Until now. The third album from the Kingston-Upon-Thames band, once the subject of a Sunday Sport incest inquiry, is a tour-de-force. Singer Tim SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skittish, straining vocals collide with wheezing fairground organ on the first two songs Baby Heart Dirt and Two Bites Of Cherry, to set a manic, cackling pace that never lets up. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hints of The Small Faces and Peter Hamill aplenty, though the six-piece group have clearly found a kooky voice of their own on the surreal piece-de-resistance The Duck And Roger The Horse. A scary and unanticipated triumph.\n\nHenry Williams \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiacs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiacs&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec533f5f8107a0d158e6bc94a4592da182d51e25","amp;dn":"Cardiacs+-+On+Land+and+in+the+Sea+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec533f5f8107a0d158e6bc94a4592da182d51e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,83,63,95,129,7,160,209,88,230,188,148,164,89,45,161,130,213,30,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
