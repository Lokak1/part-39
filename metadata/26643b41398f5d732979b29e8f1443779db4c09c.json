But it turns out that Albert Einstein really did have a daughter, Lieserl, whose 1902 birth and subsequent disappearance was shrouded in mystery. Lieserl was presumed to have died of scarlet fever as an infant. But when Jonah and Katherine return to the early 1900s to fix history, one of LieserlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents seems to understand entirely too much about time travel and what Jonah and Katherine are doing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not LieserlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, eitherÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her mother, Mileva. And Mileva has no intention of letting her daughter disappear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26643b41398f5d732979b29e8f1443779db4c09c","amp;dn":"Caught+%28The+Missing%2C+%235%29+-+Margaret+Peterson+Haddix.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26643b41398f5d732979b29e8f1443779db4c09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,100,59,65,57,143,93,115,41,121,178,158,143,20,67,119,157,180,192,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
