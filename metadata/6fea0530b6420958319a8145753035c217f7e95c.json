With its yellow colored images and sleepy atmosphere, it indeed captures some of the mindset of the era. Buildings are being torn down, people wander aimlessly, and even TokyoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s streets appear strangely quiet. The two main characters are a man suffering from amnesia, and a woman who claims to him to be his sweetheart, but in reality is his sister.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a beautiful movie with atmospheric music, some truly beautiful images, and the excessively adorable Yoshiko Yura. Yet, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a film that very much requires the interest and mindset for something that is heavily downplayed both story and character wise. It lacks aggressive social bite as well as sharp and rewarding character/psychological focus. -- sketchesofcinema.wordpress.com\n\nFF-Release Link: https://board.freakyflicks.es/showthread.php?tid=1510\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
