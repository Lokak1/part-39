For the rest of that tour, Jim Rose Circus opened.\n\nCourtney thanks the other bands on the tour for teaching them, punk rock. \n\n&quot;Cause we didn't know shit about punk rock until we got on this tour. We're new school now.&quot;\n\nThen they show them how it's done, launching into an extended purple rage of &quot;Violet.&quot;\n\n&quot;...Might last a day yeah/ Mine is forever!&quot; \n\nPrior to Asking For It that night, Courtney complains. \n\n&quot;Gimme some goddamn light, I can't fuckin see... Oh, did someone turn off the fuses? Well, I'll just set fire to Nine Inch Nails' computers, and they won't be able to do anything.&quot;\n\nAnd before you knew it was \n\n&quot;Bye bye Love / Bye my Love.&quot;\n\nActually, it was planned that way all along. \n\nHole was not booted off the tour, only off of Trent's bed, apparently. \n\nJust so there was no love lost...\n\n\nHole is on a holy roll out the barrel of Milwaukee's finest shaking hell of a lotta Love. Enjoy with the most response, the girl with the most loaded cake.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nX marks the Hole here in my money honey way mouth for you...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11023433/Hole_-_MTV_Unplugged__1995-02-14_(Unplugged__amp__More_-_SBD_CD)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11023433/Hole_-_MTV_Unplugged__1995-02-14_(Unplugged__amp__More_-_SBD_CD)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10726130/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Vengeance_Is_Mine_(1995_Radio_Live)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10726130/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Vengeance_Is_Mine_(1995_Radio_Live)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10676321/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Courtney_Act_(1990-93_Unreleased_SBD)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10676321/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Courtney_Act_(1990-93_Unreleased_SBD)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9948319/Hole_-_Reading_Festival___Hollywood_Palladium_1994_-_Pre-FM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9948319/Hole_-_Reading_Festival___Hollywood_Palladium_1994_-_Pre-FM&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/burntrentsbckweb-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/burntrentsbckweb-1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2221984a7455072cfb7b2276fa4de93ba53c00fe","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Burn+Trents+Computer+%5BMilwaukee+1994+-+open+for+NIN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2221984a7455072cfb7b2276fa4de93ba53c00fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,33,152,74,116,85,7,44,251,123,34,118,250,77,233,59,165,60,0,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
