Indeed, on the original release the music was clumped together as one composition titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonochrome Existence.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The music is deeply abstract and almost purely ambient. A beautiful and ghostly drone whispers throughout, topped occasionally with low-frequency rumbles (presumably from Laswell) and gently repeating synth figures (presumably from Inoue). With the exception of a few bursts of (mild) controlled feedback (which seem a bit out of place), the music is a warm, chalky tapestry. Like much ambient music, it appears to be almost unvarying throughout, though a deep listen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ preferably on headphones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reveals a deeply lush sonic picture. Melodies and rhythms rise and flutter byÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦or are they just stray cancellations from the last wave of sound? Either way, in the proper listening environment, Cymatic Scan is a rich record with many wonderful aural rewards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3d1b96a1902a17fa122844bb4b9c068a2a9bdf3","amp;dn":"Bill+Laswell+and+Tetsu+Inoue+-+1994+-+Cymatic+Scan+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3d1b96a1902a17fa122844bb4b9c068a2a9bdf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,209,185,106,25,2,161,127,161,34,132,75,180,185,192,104,162,169,189,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
