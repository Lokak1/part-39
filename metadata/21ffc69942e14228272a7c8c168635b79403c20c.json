Sobhan, G.P. Peterson (CRC, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nThrough analyses, experimental results, and worked-out numerical examples, Microscale and Nanoscale Heat Transfer: Fundamentals and Engineering Applications explores the methods and observations of thermophysical phenomena in size-affected domains. Compiling the most relevant findings from the literature, along with results from their own research activities, the authors provide a useful treatise on the principal concepts and practical design engineering aspects of heat transfer.\r\nThe book discusses in detail various modern engineering applications, such as microchannel heat sinks, micro heat exchangers, and micro heat pipes. It covers methods that range from discrete computation to optical measurement techniques for microscale applications. The authors also present the fundamentals of nanoscale thermal phenomena in fluids. The text concludes with an entire chapter devoted to numerical examples of microscale conduction, convective heat transfer, and radiation as well as nanoscale thermal phenomena.\r\n\r\nDrawing on their hands-on experience, the authors shed light on the differences to consider while developing engineering designs related to micro- and nanoscale systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ffc69942e14228272a7c8c168635b79403c20c","amp;dn":"Microscale+and+Nanoscale+Heat+Transfer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ffc69942e14228272a7c8c168635b79403c20c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,255,198,153,66,225,66,40,39,42,124,140,22,134,53,183,148,3,194,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
