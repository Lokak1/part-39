One primary factor in this rapid development has been the advent of computers, and the parallel study of practical and efficient algorithms. This volume represents an attempt to sample current research in one branch of combinatorics, namely combmatorial design theory, which is algorithmic in nature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1af3709add7191dc07d88c0d800cb99bbf94f0bb","amp;dn":"Algorithms+in+Combinatorial+Design+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1af3709add7191dc07d88c0d800cb99bbf94f0bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,243,112,154,221,113,145,220,7,216,140,13,128,12,185,155,191,148,240,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
