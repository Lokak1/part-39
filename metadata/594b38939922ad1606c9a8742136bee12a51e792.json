While there, they are sucked into a vortex that takes them to Avalar. All three of the Avalar worlds are in danger of falling under the power of a pint-sized dictator named Ripto. In order to save the worlds from the evil ruler, Spyro must travel through all three and collect various orbs and talismans. To navigate all 29 levels, Spyro will have to use the moves he learned during the first adventure like gliding, charge attacks, and fire breathing. For the new quest he has also learned some new moves including ice-skating, spitting items out of his mouth, and a nasty head-butt. In addition to brawn, Spyro will have to use his head to solve puzzles and earn the opportunity to play bonus games.\n\n\nTested and working on all CFW's 5.00 m33 and above using the 500 popsloader pack set on 3.72 POPS...KloWn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594b38939922ad1606c9a8742136bee12a51e792","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Spyro+2%3ARipto%5C%27s+Rage+converted+properly+%28Kingdom-ga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594b38939922ad1606c9a8742136bee12a51e792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,75,56,147,153,34,173,22,6,201,168,116,33,54,190,225,42,81,231,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
