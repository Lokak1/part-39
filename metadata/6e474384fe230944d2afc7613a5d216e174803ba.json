The album was an attempt by the group to strip down their well-known lush, psychedelic sound in order to be able to better perform the songs in concert. In order to be able to play as many new songs as possible from their new album live, the group decided (temporarily) to abandon their method of heavy overdubbing for A Question of Balance.\n\nFor the first time, The Moody Blues used political strife as a basis for songwriting with the UK number two hit in May 1970, &quot;Question&quot;, which dealt with the controversy resulting from the ongoing Vietnam War.\n\nReleased in 1970, the album reached #1 in the UK and #3 in the U.S. However, the group would abandon the stripped-down sounds of A Question of Balance for the lusher sounds of their next two albums, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Seventh Sojourn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e474384fe230944d2afc7613a5d216e174803ba","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Blues+-+A+Question+of+Balance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e474384fe230944d2afc7613a5d216e174803ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,71,67,132,254,35,9,68,210,175,199,97,58,93,33,110,23,72,3,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
