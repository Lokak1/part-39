Briefly mentioned was the illegal immigration problem as causation for the housing market crash and industry decline.\n\nSad to see some of these people have to compete and work with illegal aliens. The producers could have brought this out more to report what the issues really are. Instead there was an illegal alien ex-con gang member with a strong hispanic accent who was the only one on film employed. Even tho he was in prison for theft his dad had the nerve to say his son was a victim and lost his youth in prison unjustly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6279f93691fb5f97f4b9626787236e4055bd220d","amp;dn":"California+Dreaming+%282010%29+Documentary+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6279f93691fb5f97f4b9626787236e4055bd220d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,121,249,54,145,251,95,151,244,185,98,103,135,35,110,64,85,189,34,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
