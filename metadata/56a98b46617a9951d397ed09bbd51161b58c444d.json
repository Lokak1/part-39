In reality, it is 200 years later, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced artificial intelligence machines. The computers have created a false version of 20th-century life--the &quot;Matrix&quot;--to keep the human slaves satisfied, while the AI machines draw power from the humans. Anderson, pursued constantly by &quot;Agents&quot; (computers who take on human form and infiltrate the Matrix), is hailed as &quot;The One&quot; who will lead the humans to overthrow the machines and reclaim the Earth.\n\n\nVisit http://prince213(.)blogspot(.)com/ for more...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a98b46617a9951d397ed09bbd51161b58c444d","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a98b46617a9951d397ed09bbd51161b58c444d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,169,139,70,97,122,153,81,211,151,237,9,187,213,17,97,181,140,68,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
