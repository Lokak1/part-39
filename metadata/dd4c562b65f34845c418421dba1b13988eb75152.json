(This is the complete set for Pimsleur Mandarin One.)\n-t.\n\n\n\n**********\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nYou will find this transcript helpful if:\n1. You are a visual learner.\n2. Learning to read Chinese is just as important to you as learning to speak it.\n3. You don't want to rely on pinyin.\n4. You prefer a syllable-for-syllable transcript of what you're hearing.\n\nThese transcripts include the English narrator (12pt Times New Roman) and all of the spoken Chinese in simplified text (18pt Sim-Sun). \n\nIf you choose to print out the pages double-sided, you'll notice that the page numbers and lesson numbers are printed on the bottom outside corners. Times for the lessons are indicated at 3-minute intervals on the outside margin next to the corresponding line of dialogue.\n\nEnjoy your studies,\n-taryn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4c562b65f34845c418421dba1b13988eb75152","amp;dn":"Mandarin+I+-+ALL+-+2010.11.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4c562b65f34845c418421dba1b13988eb75152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,76,86,43,101,243,72,69,196,24,66,29,186,27,19,152,142,183,81,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
