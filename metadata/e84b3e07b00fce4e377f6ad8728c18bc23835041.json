They only have mp3 quality same as lime.\n\nIf they had a loss-less format on itunes, that would be different.\n\n\nI have included both win and mac versions here, no sense in having 2 torrents\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e84b3e07b00fce4e377f6ad8728c18bc23835041","amp;dn":"Limewire+Pirate+Fix+Feb+-+Mar+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e84b3e07b00fce4e377f6ad8728c18bc23835041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,75,62,7,176,15,206,78,55,127,106,216,114,140,24,188,35,131,80,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
