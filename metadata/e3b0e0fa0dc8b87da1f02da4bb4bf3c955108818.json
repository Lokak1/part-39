Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nThe story of a fierce revolutionary and a gay window dresser imprisoned together in  an oppressive Latin American country. Adapted into a wonderful film in 1985.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nSometimes they talk all night long. In the still darkness of their cell, Molina re-weaves the glittering and fragile stories of the film he loves, and the cynical Valentin listens. Valentin believes in the just cause which makes all suffering bearable; Molina believes in the magic of love which makes all else endurable. Each has always been alone, and always - especially now - in danger of betrayal. But in cell 7 each surrenders to the other something of himself that he has never surrendered before.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Dazzling...a triumph&quot; Observer \n\n&quot;Puig dazzles one with sheer technical ability&quot; Newsday\n\n&quot;In exceptional form, Puig weaves his own shimmering web around a classic theme&quot; Newsweek\n\n&quot;Richly ambivalent and mysterious&quot; Washington Post\n\n\n\n-----------------\n\nThe film version is here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8337062&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8337062&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b0e0fa0dc8b87da1f02da4bb4bf3c955108818","amp;dn":"Manuel+Puig+-+Kiss+of+the+Spider+Woman+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b0e0fa0dc8b87da1f02da4bb4bf3c955108818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,176,224,250,13,200,184,125,161,240,45,164,187,75,243,201,85,16,136,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
