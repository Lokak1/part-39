Douglas Price\nMcGraw-Hill | November 2009 | PDF | ISBN10: 0073531057 | 640 pages | 65.8 mb\n\nThis well illustrated, full-color, site-by-site survey of prehistory captures the popular interest, excitement, and visual splendor of archaeology as it provides insight into the research, interpretations, and theoretical themes in the field. The new edition maintains the authors' innovative solutions to two central problems of the course: first, the text continues to focus on about 80 sites, giving students less encyclopedic detail but essential coverage of the discoveries that have produced the major insights into prehistory  second, it continues to be organized into essays on sites and concepts, allowing professors complete flexibility in organizing their courses.\n\nAbout the Author\nT. Douglas Price was born in New Haven in 1945. Many homes during childhood. Louisville and Kansas City stand out. Educated and acculturated at the University of Michigan. Doug is Weinstein Professor of European Archaeology emeritus and Director of the Laboratory for Archaeological Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he has been on the faculty for more than 35 years. He was also 6th Century Chair in Archaeological Science in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen, now retired. He does archaeological fieldwork on early agriculture in Denmark and laboratory studies of isotopes in human tooth enamel to look at questions of prehistoric migration. He is the author of a number of books and articles on archaeology. He likes archaeology, small children, food, football, Anne Birgitte, and the family dog Bagel. He doesn't like long, self-promoting descriptions of book authors.\n\nCONTENTS\nPREFACE xi\nABOUT THE AUTHORS xvii\nCHAPTER ONE Principles of Archaeology 1\nCHAPTER TWO The First Humans 35\nCHAPTER THREE Out of Africa: Homo Erectus 73\nCHAPTER FOUR The Hunters 105\nCHAPTER FIVE Postglacial Foragers 165\nCHAPTER SIX The Origins of Agriculture 199\nCHAPTER SEVEN Native North Americans 267\nCHAPTER EIGHT Ancient Mesoamerica 321\nCHAPTER NINE South America: The Inca and Their Predecessors 391\nCHAPTER TEN States and Empires in Asia and Africa 437\nCHAPTER ELEVEN Prehistoric Europe 507\nCHAPTER TWELVE The Past as Present and Future 561\nAPPENDIX: COMMON MEASUREMENT \nCONVERSIONS AND EQUIVALENTS 576\nGLOSSARY G-1\nREFERENCES R-1\nCREDITS C-1\nINDEX I-1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98005383e69ecea005e48b20987a313b7c1f1cf","amp;dn":"Images+of+the+Past","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f98005383e69ecea005e48b20987a313b7c1f1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,128,5,56,62,105,236,234,0,94,72,178,9,135,163,19,183,193,241,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
