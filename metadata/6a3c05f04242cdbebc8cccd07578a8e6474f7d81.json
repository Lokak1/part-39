They&amp;#039;re touring with The Faint and Jaguar Love right now. They are an amazing show.\n\nFrom allmusic.com\n\nBiography\t\nby Kenyon Hopkin\n\nPete Cafarella (keyboard, vocals) and Nate Smith (drums), both former members of El Guapo, formed Shy Child just after the two moved to New York City. Cafarella had also previously worked with composer Anthony Braxton, while Smith had played drums with Touchdown (Troubleman Records). The duo&amp;#039;s first record, Please Consider Our Time, was given proper release by Montreal&amp;#039;s Grenadine Records in 2002, with the Humanity EP following in late 2003. After a brief tour of Japan in early 2004, Shy Child recorded One With the Sun with producer Chris Zane (Les Savy Fav, Calla), which was released on Say Hey Records in October 2004. \n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.
