Written by P.D. James; Full-cast dramatisation starring Richard Derrington as Adam Dalgliesh, Deborah McAndrew as Kate Miskin and with Carolyn Pickles as Emma Lavenham.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, a witch is burned in a stone circle. Three hundred and fifty years later, an investigative journalist arrives at a nearby clinic to have cosmetic surgery - and a week later, she is dead.\n\nDalgliesh and his team, called in to investigate the murder and later a second equally horrific death, find themselves confronted with problems even more complicated than the question of innocence or guilt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7afe0c61a87c66d9512cf2634cb8a397d4fe615","amp;dn":"P.D.+James+-+The+Private+Patient+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7afe0c61a87c66d9512cf2634cb8a397d4fe615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,175,224,198,26,135,198,109,149,18,207,38,52,203,138,57,125,79,230,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
