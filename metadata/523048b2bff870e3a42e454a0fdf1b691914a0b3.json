This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey says this is the first time in chart history that the number one and number two songs were written and produced by a single individual.\n\nThere is a former top five song in the countdown inspired by a sleeping lady's-room attendant.\n\nCasey says that a track on the British release version of the Beatles album, &quot;Sergeant Pepper's&quot; can't be played on the radio because it would be against FCC broadcast regulations and then gives the details.\n\nIn the history of the album chart, only three bands have had a number one album after breaking up and then getting back together. One of them is in this countdown.\n\nA man writes in asking for a long-distance dedication, but forgets to choose a song, so the AT40 staff picks a song for him.\n\nTwo listeners ask the question; &quot;Have different songs with the same title ever been in the top 40 at the same time?&quot; Casey says it has only happened twice (with songs named Crazy Love and Superstar), and plays portions of each of the songs.\n\nThere is a band in the top ten who was offered a record deal without recording any demos or performing any auditions. Casey explains.\n\nLW#1: Total Eclipse Of The Heart - Bonnie Tyler\n40:    Foolin' - Def Leppard\n39:    Can't Shake Loose - Agnetha Faltskog\n38:    Heart And Soul - Huey Lewis &amp; The News        \n37:    Dr. Heckyll &amp; Mr. Jive - Men At Work     \n36:    Modern Love - David Bowie     \n35:    What Am I Gonna Do - Rod Stewart    \n34:    She Works Hard For The Money - Donna Summer\n33:    It Must Be Love - Madness\n32:    Uptown Girl - Billy Joel\n31:    This Time - Bryan Adams\n30:    Kiss The Bride - Elton John\n29:    Don't Forget To Dance - The Kinks    \n28:    Sitting At The Wheel - The Moody Blues\n27:    Dead Giveaway - Shalamar\n26:    Every Breath You Take - The Police\n25:    If Anyone Falls - Stevie Nicks\nLDD: Martha My Dear - The Beatles\n24:    Human Nature - Michael Jackson\n23:    Suddenly Last Summer - The Motels\n22:    Sweet Dreams - The Eurythmics\n21:    Big Log - Robert Plant\n20:    Tonight I Celebrate My Love - Peabo Bryson\n19:    Don't Cry - Asia\n18:    Puttin' On The Ritz - Taco\n17:    Delirious - Prince\n16:    Telefone (Long Distance Love Affair) - Sheena Easton\n15:    Burning Down The House - Talking Heads\n14:    All Night Long (All Night) - Lionel Richie\n13:    Maniac - Michael Sembello\n12:    How Am I Supposed To Live Without You - Laura Branigan\nLDD: When I Need You - Leo Sayer\n11:    Promises, Promises - Naked Eyes\n10:    Far From Over - Frank Stallone\n9:    One Thing Leads To Another - The Fixx\n8:    The Safety Dance - Men Without Hats\n7:    Tell Her About It - Billy Joel\n6:    Islands In The Stream - Kenny Rogers Duet With Dolly Parton\n5:    (She's) Sexy + 17 - The Stray Cats\n4:    True - Spandau Ballet\n3:    King Of Pain - The Police\n2:    Making Love Out Of Nothing At All - Air Supply\n1:    Total Eclipse Of The Heart - Bonnie Tyler\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523048b2bff870e3a42e454a0fdf1b691914a0b3","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1983_October_8th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523048b2bff870e3a42e454a0fdf1b691914a0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,48,72,178,191,248,112,227,164,46,69,74,15,223,27,105,25,20,160,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
