Unlike Larry LaLonde of Primus, who also assembled a Zappa anthology for Rykodisc, Fishman's picks aren't as wide-ranging, featuring just 16 tracks from ten Zappa albums (almost exclusively from the 1970s), and they don't include nearly enough memorable performances by the late guitarist and composer, while incorporating filler tracks like &quot;Wait a Minute&quot; and &quot;What Ever Happened to All the Fun in the World.&quot; Newcomers to Zappa's music will be better served by picking up LaLonde's more thoughtfully assembled anthology, or better yet, one sequenced by Zappa himself. \n\n1  Excentrifugal Forz song review  \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa 1:33    \n\n2  Apostrophe \nJack Bruce / Jim Gordon / Frank Zappa  \nFrank Zappa  5:50    \n\n3  Magdalena \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   6:24    \n\n4  Dog Breath \nFrank Zappa  \nFrank Zappa 3:35    \n    \n5  Cheepnis \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa 6:33    \n    \n6  Son of Orange County \nFrank Zappa  \nFrank Zappa 6:13    \n\n7  More Trouble Every Day \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   5:40        \n\n8  It Can't Happen Here \nFrank Zappa  \nFrank Zappa   3:55    \n\n\n9  Keep It Greasey song review  \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   8:21    \n    \n10  For Calvin (And His Next Two Hitch-Hikers) song review  \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa 6:06        \n\n11  What Ever Happened to All the Fun in the World song review  \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   0:33    \n    \n12  Rat Tomago song review  \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   5:17    \n\n13  Wait a Minute song review  \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   0:31       \n\n14  It Just Might Be a One-Shot Deal song review  \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   4:16    \n\n15  I'm the Slime \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   3:34    \n\n16  Sofa No. 2 \nFrank Zappa \nFrank Zappa   2:41  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0025f37fd47930fc3801a6afc3a740c33238ccec","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+2002+-+Zappa+Picks+-+by+Jon+Fishman+of+Phish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0025f37fd47930fc3801a6afc3a740c33238ccec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,37,243,127,212,121,48,252,56,1,166,175,195,167,64,195,50,56,204,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
