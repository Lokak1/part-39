Afterwards the file \nis converted with PowerDirector 8 to mpg since I think, it is the most popular\nformat everybody can handle.\n\nHope, you enjoy my CabRide-torrents and share it to others.\nPlease keep seeding.\n\n*******************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34273ab3d002aaee4cceb3d925d961a34adb1250","amp;dn":"Trains.Greece.Piraeus.to.Korinth.CabRide.dTV.SVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34273ab3d002aaee4cceb3d925d961a34adb1250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,39,58,179,208,2,170,238,76,206,179,217,37,217,97,163,74,219,18,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
