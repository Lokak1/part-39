A little circular was put in my hand one day at a federated club meeting announcing the fact that in a few weeks there would be a coldÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢pack demonstration about fifty miles away. Immediately I announced that I was going to the\ndemonstrations. So leaving my small daughter with my mother, I went to the Normal School at DeKalb, Illinois, and heard and saw for the first time coldÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢pack canning.\n\nIt is sufficient to say that those three days were so crowded full of interest and new messages on the gospel of canning that I felt amply repaid for going fifty miles. As a result of that trip, the first story ever published on coldÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢pack canning appeared in _The Country Gentleman_ and I had the pleasure of writing it. So enthused was I over this new, efficient and easy way to can not only fruits but hard vegetables, such as peas, corn and beans, that I wanted to carry the good news into the kitchen of other busy housewives and mothers.\n\nMy mother had insisted that I take with me my younger sister, just from college, but with no domestic science tendencies. So, much against her wishes, preferring rather to do some settlement work, my sister went with me. The canning was so interesting that for the first time in her life, my sister became enthusiastic over one phase of cooking. My mother was so pleased at this zeal that when she received my sister's letter written from DeKalb, saying, &quot;Mother, I am enthused about this canning and want to can everything in sight this summer,&quot;\nshe hastily washed all available glass jars and tops and had everything in readiness for young daughter's return. And we canned. We were not content to can alone but invited all the neighbors in and taught them how to can. Our community canned more things and more unusual things, including the hard vegetables, that year than they had ever attempted before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3325af5b2d25e8fc692d93680ee842eec5f34ead","amp;dn":"Every+Step+In+Canning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3325af5b2d25e8fc692d93680ee842eec5f34ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,37,175,91,45,37,232,252,105,45,147,104,14,232,66,238,197,243,78,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
