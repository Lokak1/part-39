Set for a January 22, 2008 release, this confident collection of songs follows up the band\\&amp;#039;s self-released / self-financed album, GIVE `EM ALL A BIG FAT LIP, which caught the attention of many, including Rolling Stone Magazine who declared the Athens GA three-piece \\&quot;the best unsigned band in America.\\&quot; The Whigs spent most of 2006 and 2007 on the road winning over fans and critics with their full throttle alternative pop / rock which NPR hailed as a perfect combination of \\&quot;the gravelly rock of The Replacements with the off-kilter pop of Guided By Voices.\\&quot; Eager to record their ATO debut, The Whigs entered the legendary Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles, CA with producer Rob Schnapf (Beck, Elliott Smith). Sonically superior to anything the band has recorded to date, MISSION CONTROL is an album jam-packed with infectious melodies and dynamic rhythms. The urgency of opening track \\&quot;Like A Vibration\\&quot; knocks over the listener with a roaring attack of guitars, while \\&quot;Production City\\&quot; combines a dancing bass line over machine gun tight rhythms. Julian Dorio is a staple throughout, but on the soon to be anthem \\&quot;Right Hand on My Heart,\\&quot; Dorio\\&amp;#039;s playing makes it evident why Esquire Magazine named him \\&quot;Drummer of the Year\\&quot; in 2007. The Whigs will spend the rest of 2007 on the road gearing up for the release of MISSION CONTROL.\n\n1. Like A Vibration\t\t \n2. Production City\t\n3. I Never Want To Go Home\t\n4.
