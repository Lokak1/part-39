Through his trumpet teachers he came into contact with jazz and improvised music. In 1988 Eric Vloeimans graduated with honors. In 1989 he received a scholarship to continue his studies at the New School in New York. There he performed with the Frank Foster and Mercer Ellington bands, among others. Since 1989 Vloeimans has been active in a wide variety of ensembles and since then is one of the best known &quot;jazz exports&quot; of the Netherlands. This small and unusual trio setting is perfect to emphasize the skills of Eric: no bass, no drums - so Vloeimans is able to put his sound and his ideas on top. Eric is no longer a talent - he has established himself on the top of the European trumpet-league...\n\nTracklist:\n~~~~~~\n01. Morimond [0:05:41.46]\n02. Summersault [0:05:21.29]\n03.
