The focus of the text moves from highly prescriptive languages to very descriptive languages, demonstrating the many and varied ways in which we can think about programming. Designed for interactive learning both inside and outside of the classroom, each programming paradigm is highlighted through the implementation of a non-trivial programming language, demonstrating when each language may be appropriate for a given problem. Features: includes review questions and solved practice exercises, with supplementary code and support files available from an associated website; provides the foundations for understanding how the syntax of a language is formally defined by a grammar; examines assembly language programming using CoCo; introduces C++, Standard ML, and Prolog; describes the development of a type inference system for the language Small","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e6741720a659db1d900a26b3c33752fd16963c","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Programming+Languages+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e6741720a659db1d900a26b3c33752fd16963c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,230,116,23,32,166,89,219,29,144,10,38,179,195,55,82,253,22,150,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
