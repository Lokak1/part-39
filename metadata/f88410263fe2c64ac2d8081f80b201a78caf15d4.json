Burnside, A Ass Pocket of Whiskey documents a single noisy, spirited session with Burnside, his sideman Kenny Brown, and the punk-bred blues reconstructionist trio called the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The pairing of JSBE, led by a white Ivy League dropout turned downtown New York scuz who poses as a hard-living blues rocker, and R.L. Burnside, the last of the real down-home badass bluesmen of the Mississippi hills, is strange--perhaps sacrilege to blues purists--but oddly appropriate. And the moments of pure musical chaos caught on this record--both cross-cultural and cross-generational--sound entirely within the realm of both acts. With its unorthodox accompaniment (including wheezy theremin and Spencer&amp;#039;s trademark shouts), the album is probably not the most fitting introduction to Burnside. But as the oldest man ever to record for the hip indie-rockers at Matador, no doubt he gladly sacrificed juke-joint obscurity for the chance to appear on MTV&amp;#039;s 120 Minutes. --Roni Sarig&quot;\n\n- \n\nIt&amp;#039;s good to see R.L. getting some attention from the &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot; movie and soundtrack. This torrent is 100% complete and is available from me from Monday through Friday from 7:30AM to 5:00PM EST. It will be more and more available and the download will be much faster if you, the downloader, SEED! At least for a while. I know it eats up bandwidth and makes it hard for you to download other stuff. Hell, I&amp;#039;m guilty of leeching too. We all are. But this album is so good it would be a crime not to share it.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recording as much as I have for the past 8+ years.\n\nEmail me with any questions or problems at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ed9d8c98818488b29d828e8688999ead948c858282c38e8280c3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f88410263fe2c64ac2d8081f80b201a78caf15d4","amp;dn":"RL+Burnside+-+A+Ass+Pocket+Of+Whiskey+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f88410263fe2c64ac2d8081f80b201a78caf15d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,132,16,38,63,226,198,74,194,216,8,31,128,178,1,167,140,175,21,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
