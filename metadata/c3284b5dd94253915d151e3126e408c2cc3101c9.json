They test the chemical on a pilot and he changes into a mindless but indestructable automaton possessing superhuman strength. It is up to the people of Metropolis to somehow outwit Graal before he can create an army of these soldiers, otherwise their planet will be destroyed.\n\nThis insane Italian/Turkish co-production is a Star Wars rip-off filled with enough goofy special effects, cheap sets, and hilarious dialogue to keep you laughing the entire running time. The films great cast includes Richard Kiel (Jaws from the 007 films), Arthur Kennedy (Lawrence of Arabis) , Ivan Rassimov (Eaten Alive, Jungle Holocaust) and was made by an all-star Italian crew that included Enzo G. Castellari, Giannetto De Rossi, Antonio Margheriti and score by Ennio Morricone.\n\n\n96mins\nHard coded japanese subtitles\nDecombed from NTSC format\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3284b5dd94253915d151e3126e408c2cc3101c9","amp;dn":"The+Humanoid+-+1979+-+VHSRiP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3284b5dd94253915d151e3126e408c2cc3101c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,40,75,93,217,66,83,145,93,21,30,49,38,228,8,194,204,49,1,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
