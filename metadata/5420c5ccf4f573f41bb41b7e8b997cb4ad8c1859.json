Kelly is a blues craftsman - a journeyman who has served his time with the best.\n\nIn New York he jammed with Muddy Waters.  He became a friend to Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker, who both felt the benefit of Dave's playing in their touring bands.  It was Dave's big sister, the late Jo-Ann Kelly, who first opened his ears to the blues, although his passion for rock and roll - and especially the work of Buddy Holly - remains intact.  In 1967 he joined The John Dummer Blues Band.  After three albums and a solo project he continued to polish his style and technique throughout an adventurous career with some of Britain's finest players.  When The Blues Band was formed in 1979, the post of slide guitarist and joint vocalist was a foregone conclusion - and bringing his friend, the bassist Gary Fletcher, along to that first rehearsal, was a bonus.  Dave Kelly's guitar and vocals form the very backbone of The Blues Band's distinctive sound. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n   1. Don't Sell It Away\n   2. Two Trains Running\n   3. Mean Old Frisco\n   4.
