This set of tutorials got me up and running in no time. These Vid's are very helpful. The guy who teaches you is someone who actually uses AutoCad for a living, so he is very competent in his teaching. By the time you finish these tutorials, you will be able to start creating your work in AutoCad with relative ease.\n\nGood luck, and enjoy.\n\nPLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT ATLEAST 1:1 RATIO.
