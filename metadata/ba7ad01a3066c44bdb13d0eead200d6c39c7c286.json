It was released on 26 October 2004 through Relapse Records. The music is a full length exploration of the atmospheric interludes heard on Nile's previous albums, and still draws on ancient Babylonia and Lovecraftian themes for inspiration. The album was well received by metal and non-metal listeners alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba7ad01a3066c44bdb13d0eead200d6c39c7c286","amp;dn":"Karl+Sanders+-+Saurian+Meditation+%28FLAC%2C+2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba7ad01a3066c44bdb13d0eead200d6c39c7c286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,122,208,26,48,102,196,75,219,19,208,238,173,32,13,108,57,199,194,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
