Joe - A Real American Hero #155.5-183 + Annual (2010-2012)\nPublisher:  IDW Publishing\nPublication Date:  May 1, 2010 - October 17, 2012\n\nG.I. Joe: A Real American Hero debuted as a comic book by Marvel Comics under license from Hasbro in 1982.  It was an instant success.  Larry Hama quickly became the regular writer on the series and was working directly with Hasbro on the toy line at the same time.  That series lasted roughly a dozen years and 155 issues.  155 months in a row, Larry and various other creators produced a massively successful G.I. Joe comic book.\n\nFlash forward to 2009.  Hasbro and IDW Publishing re-launched G.I. Joe with a new beginning.  Nothing that anyone had read before has happened.  This has been an exciting experience for both new and old fans, but it did leave behind a rich history that was still open to development.\n\nPicking up from where the original G.I. JOE: A REAL AMERICAN HERO comic book ended (#155), Real American Hero is a core fan's dream come true! Larry Hama continues his classic G.I. JOE run right here, and relaunches the original series!\n\nG.I.
