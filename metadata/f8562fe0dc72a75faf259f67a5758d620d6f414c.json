Introductory Scrum courses tell you Ã¢â‚¬ËœwhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ you need to do but not Ã¢â‚¬ËœhowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to do it. This course shows you, through detailed examples and checklists, Ã¢â‚¬ËœhowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to be a Scrum Master.\n\nIn this course, you will learn:\n\n    The mindset of successful Scrum Masters. You will learn how your mindset influences your actions and how to construct an effective mindset.\n\n    How to create your daily, weekly, and monthly rhythms. What do you need to do every day as a Scrum Master? What do you need to do every week and every month?\n\n    The ABC technique: How to build relationships with key people in your organization to increase the success of your Scrum teams.\n\n    EXACTLY how to facilitate the planning, review, and retrospective meetings. When you become an effective facilitator, you will radically improve your teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cohesion and velocity.\n\n    A way to communicate through conflict. Learn how to break down every difficult conversation into four steps.\n\n    How to collaborate with managers on Scrum. You will learn what managers care about and how they think about Scrum. You will learn how to set up and launch an Enterprise Agile Team.\n\n    The characteristics of a servant leader and how to increase your ability to serve the team.\n\nYou will get tools and checklists that take the STRESS out of being a Scrum Master.\n\nIn addition to the course material, you will receive two one-on-one 25 minute coaching sessions with me. I will share with you what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned training and consulting at Carbonite, edX, Paypal, Symantec, Philips, Verizon, and a dozen other companies. You will also be invited to a group monthly coaching call. In addition, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to ask questions at any time using the questions area of the course. This is like having a PERSONAL TUTOR as you Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlevel upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ your Scrum Master skills.\n\nWho am I?
