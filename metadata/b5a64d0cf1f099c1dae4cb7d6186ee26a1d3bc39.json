The sound quality is as good as it gets.****\n\nIn &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;, Billy Idol, who&amp;#039;s survived his share of adversity, proves that in middle age he still has what it takes to keep an audience happy. The DVD taped in New York in April 2001 contains the following songs: \n1. Cradle of Love \n2. Don&amp;#039;t Need a Gun \n3. Flesh For Fantasy \n4. White Wedding \n5. Sweet 16 \n6. To Be a Lover \n7. Rebel Yell \n8. Kiss Me Deadly \n9. Eyes Without a Face \n10. Dancing with Myself \n11. Untouchables \n12. Ready Steady Go \n13. Blue Highway \n14. Mony Mony \n15. LA Woman \n\nThe band includes: \nSteve McGrath-bass \nSteve Stevens-guitar \nGreg Ellis-percussion \nMark Schulman-drums \nJoseph Simon-keyboard \n\nThis intimate performance takes place in a small NY club setting. In between songs, Idol drops details of how some of the songs came to be written, and Idol&amp;#039;s charismatic personality comes through as he shares memories with his audience. He&amp;#039;s obviously happy to be there and having a rapt audience boosts his performance even more. He&amp;#039;s funny, he&amp;#039;s entertaining, and his music has stood the test of time. \n\nThis is an older Billy Idol, and some of that is reflected in his memories, but the performance is still an incredible event for fans. Idol alters the lyrics in some of the songs, and the audience loves it--singing, and clapping during old favourites such as White Wedding, Dancing With Myself, and Mony Mony. Idol also talks about his Generation X days and includes songs from that period of his career. For Idol fans, it&amp;#039;s wonderful to hear these songs performed again without all the glitzy MTV trappings.
