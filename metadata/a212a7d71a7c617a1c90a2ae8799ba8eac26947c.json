But, its approach is different, and so are its contributions. Philosophy has not built any bridges, but has shown . mankind the pathway. It has not invented a bulb, but has brought light to the world. It has not erected any nuclear power plants, but has\r\nenergized human minds. That's philosophy, the branch of knowledge that considers questions above answers. Because, it is the question that leads and the answer just follows.\r\nThis issue of Tell Me Why tells you about great thinkers and their contributions.\r\n \nhttp://s22.postimg.org/i9wxv3hdt/Great_Thinkers.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a212a7d71a7c617a1c90a2ae8799ba8eac26947c","amp;dn":"Great+Thinkers+%28Tell+Me+Why+93%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a212a7d71a7c617a1c90a2ae8799ba8eac26947c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,18,167,215,26,124,97,122,28,144,162,174,135,153,186,142,172,38,148,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
