Thor Heyerdahl's adventures in Kon-Tiki and in The Ra Expeditions proved that it could be done, and now the idea is not considered unusual at all. This documentary of his journey in a crude papyrus raft from Morocco to the Caribbean is entertaining and enlightening stuff. As the film (narrated by Heyerdahl and Lee Brown) shows, there was considerable doubt that Heyerdahl and his crew of eight would survive, much less make it to their destinations. Indeed, their first effort foundered after several hundred miles, and the second, a year later, nearly failed in ferocious ocean storms.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 448x304, 29.970 fps, 927 Kbps, 01h43m42s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nVHSRip, film print not well preserved, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/hx56mpgmf/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/bn6lr7ihl/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/fv1dzyjx5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5oxdupowp/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/d3i49cleh/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b4472c41260dcd5d9ba5b61a63a6ddd525e397b","amp;dn":"The+Ra+Expeditions+%281972+-+Sweden%2C+Norway%29+Thor+Heyerdahl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b4472c41260dcd5d9ba5b61a63a6ddd525e397b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,68,114,196,18,96,220,213,217,186,91,97,166,58,109,221,82,94,57,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
