As one of the few resources to focus on implementing algorithms in the shared-memory model of multi-core processors, rather than just on theoretical models or distributed-memory architectures, The Art of Concurrency provides the knowledge and hands-on experience you need. You'll get detailed explanations and usable samples to help you transform algorithms from serial to parallel code, along with advice and analysis to steer you clear of mistakes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc60ee578ea90e58b6df269afcc4f62dc62dd32","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Concurrency.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc60ee578ea90e58b6df269afcc4f62dc62dd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,198,14,229,120,234,144,229,139,109,242,105,175,204,79,98,220,98,221,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
