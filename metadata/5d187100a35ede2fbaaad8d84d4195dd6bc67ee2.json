With bassist Neil Mosc and drummer Tom Cottone rounding out the lineup, Fossil is a consistent, and at times extraordinary, collection of well-crafted pop/rock defined by articulate lyrics and melodic craftsmanship. &quot;Moon&quot; leads things off with a wall of dense, driving guitars and some clever wordplay. On &quot;Tim, &quot; the band manages to appropriate the harmonies and vibe of Jellyfish to good effect. &quot;Martyr's Wife&quot; is a wry look at the life of Jesus from a significant other all over a soundtrack of fuzz-tone guitars and crystalline percussion. And, on &quot;Josephine Baker, &quot; Staley adds mandolin to the gentle ache of O'Gureck's lament that he pines for the love of the late entertainer. Fossil has managed to deliver a fresh, intelligent, buoyant pop album with their debut that is a joyful listen from start to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d187100a35ede2fbaaad8d84d4195dd6bc67ee2","amp;dn":"Fossil+-+Fossil+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d187100a35ede2fbaaad8d84d4195dd6bc67ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,24,113,0,163,94,222,47,186,170,216,216,77,65,149,221,107,198,126,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
