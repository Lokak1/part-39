Blood, Bones &amp; Butter follows an unconventional journey through  :\n : the many kitchens Hamilton has inhabited through the years: the rural      :\n : kitchen of her childhood, where her adored mother stood over the six-burner:\n : with an oily wooden spoon in hand; the kitchens of France, Greece, and     :\n : Turkey, where she was often fed by complete strangers and learned the      :\n : essence of hospitality; Hamilton's own kitchen at Prune, with its many     :\n : unexpected challenges; and the kitchen of her Italian mother-in-law, who   :\n : serves as the link between Hamilton's idyllic past and her own future      :\n : family--the result of a prickly marriage that nonetheless yields lasting   :\n : dividends. By turns epic and intimate, Gabrielle Hamilton's story is told  :\n : with uncommon honesty, grit, humor, and passion.                           :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99ec9af9c237665ffec4e7aefa9e386d99b6a9ad","amp;dn":"Gabrielle+Hamilton+Blood+Bones+and+Butter+2011+Retail+EPUB+eBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99ec9af9c237665ffec4e7aefa9e386d99b6a9ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,236,154,249,194,55,102,95,254,196,231,174,250,158,56,109,153,182,169,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
