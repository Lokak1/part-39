The project took its first steps on August 24, 2013, when a London-based radio station TeamRock Radio aired the first one-hour episode of Ziltoid Radio, a satirical radio show hosted solely by Ziltoid.[6] Later, Townsend stated that &quot;Z Radio is just one little element of the ZÃ‚Â² project&quot;.[7] After several Ziltoid Radio episodes aired, Townsend said he found the project hard to schedule and work with amidst touring and writing,[8][9] because he doesn't want to just &quot;phone it in&quot;, and &quot;it takes a lot of effort&quot; to keep the content with tongue-in-cheek humour entertaining.[10][11] A total of seven Ziltoid Radio episodes aired between August 2013 and January 2014, and since then there has been no discussion or activity considering the series or its affiliation with the ZÃ‚Â² project. The episodes have since been removed from TeamRock Radio's website. Townsend has also discussed a &quot;ZTV&quot; or &quot;Ziltoid TV&quot;, being a part of the ZÃ‚Â² project and preceding the album.\n\n=============================================//\n\nCD 1: Sky Blue: \n\n01 - Rejoice.flac          \n02 - Fallout.flac          \n03 - Midnight Sun.flac     \n04 - A New Reign.flac      \n05 - Universal Flame.flac  \n06 - Warrior.flac          \n07 - Sky Blue.flac         \n08 - Silent Militia.flac   \n09 - Rain City.flac\n10 - Forever.flac\n11 - Before We Die.flac\n12 - The Ones Who Love.flac\ncover.jpg\ncoverMain.jpg\nThe Devin Townsend Project - ZÃ‚Â² - Sky Blue.log\nThe Devin Townsend Project - ZÃ‚Â² - Sky Blue.m3u\nZÃ‚Â² - Sky Blue.cue\n\nCD 2: Dark Matters: \n\n01 - ZÃ‚Â².flac\n02 - From Sleep Awake.flac\n03 - Ziltodian Empire.flac\n04 - War Princess.flac\n05 - Deathray.flac\n06 - March Of The Poozers.flac\n07 - Wandering Eye.flac\n08 - Earth.flac\n09 - Ziltoid Goes Home.flac\n10 - Through The Wormhole.flac\n11 - Dimension Z.flac\ncover.jpg\ncoverMain.jpg\nZÃ‚Â² - Dark Matters.cue\nZiltoid - ZÃ‚Â² - Dark Matters.log\nZiltoid - ZÃ‚Â² - Dark Matters.m3u\nÃ¢â€“ÂºPromotional Content\n  DEVIN TOWNSEND PROJECT - Deathray (Lyric Video).mp4 (1080p)\n  DEVIN TOWNSEND PROJECT - Rejoice (Lyric Video).mp4 (1080p)\n  moon.ogg [80 kB/s (from ziltoid.com)]\n  Z2 Album Teaser.mp4 (1080p)\n  Ziltoid Commands You at The Royal Albert Hall.mp4 (1080p)\n  Ã¢â€“ÂºZiltoid TV (ZTV)\n    cover.jpg  \n    ZTV Episode 1.mp4 (1080p)\n    ZTV Episode 2.mp4 (1080p)\n    ZTV Episode 3.mp4(MISSING Expected release date Oct. 28th)\n  Ã¢â€“ÂºLoud Park 13 (Japan Bonus)\n    DEVIN TOWNSEND PROJECT LIVE IN JAPAN (LIVE AT THE LOUDPARK2013).mp4 (480p)\nÃ¢â€“ÂºZiltoid Radio\n  130820 - Ziltoid Radio Reveal.mp3\n  130824 - Ziltoid Radio Episode 01.ogg\n  130907 - Ziltoid Radio Episode 02.mp3\n  130921 - Ziltoid Radio Episode 03.ogg\n  131005 - Ziltoid Radio Episode 04.ogg\n  131102 - Ziltoid Radio Episode 05.mp3\n  131116 - Ziltoid Radio Episode 06.mp3\n  131225 - Ziltoid Radio Christmas Speech '13.ogg\n  140104 - Ziltoid Radio Episode 07.ogg\n  ziltoidradio.jpg\n\n===========================================//\n\nAll .flac, too many sources to count.
