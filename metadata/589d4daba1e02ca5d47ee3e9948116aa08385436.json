Looking to\n    carry on this yin and yang tradition are two talented young women, singer\n    Emily Armstrong and guitarist Siouxsie Medley, who front Los Angeles' Dead\n    Sara -- an electrifying four-piece rock band whose supercharged music is\n    propelled by Medley's exhilarating, monster guitar riffs and Armstrong's\n    powerful, wailing vocals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:589d4daba1e02ca5d47ee3e9948116aa08385436","amp;dn":"Dead_Sara-Dead_Sara-2012-MTD+%2A%2ANEW%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"589d4daba1e02ca5d47ee3e9948116aa08385436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,157,77,171,161,224,44,165,212,126,227,233,148,129,22,170,8,56,84,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
