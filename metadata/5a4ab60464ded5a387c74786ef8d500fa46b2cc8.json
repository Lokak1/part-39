Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple has to decide between two major renovation projects, and each one requires a full kitchen overhaul. The couple makes their choice but a reduced budget, and issues with the existing structure of the kitchen, force Jonathan to redesign the plan. The couple stands firm on having in-floor heating and even starts to add new elements to their list of must-haves. To keep costs down, Jonathan has no choice but to force the couple to roll up their sleeves and get dirty.\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4ab60464ded5a387c74786ef8d500fa46b2cc8","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e10.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a4ab60464ded5a387c74786ef8d500fa46b2cc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,74,182,4,100,222,213,163,135,199,71,134,239,141,80,15,164,107,44,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
