The Comic follows the adventures of CaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Anon and Richard, as well as their companions. Since its launch on November 26, 2006, it has received positive attention from the webcomics community at large. \n\nThere is a place, set in a reality and time unlike our own where the eating of small children is not necessarily frowned upon; where beings of extraordinary power can destroy entire villages with only &quot;because I could&quot; as an excuse; where families are comically torn apart and sold into slavery in exchange for powerful weapons or a really nice hat; where prophecy, magic and adventure is as common place as setting fire to, then reanimating a chipmunk into a skeletal minion (it happens more than you'd think); and where an epic journey can begin by an accident of fate.\n\nThis is the world of Looking For Group.\nLooking For Group is a free comic that is updated several times a week and is generally looked at as a Fantasy/Science fiction parody series that pokes heavy fun at everything World of Warcraft, Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, RA Salvatore, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, George RR Martin, Everquest, Star Wars and anything else we enjoy, derived from Video Games, Film, Television, Books and Graphic Novels.\n\nWe invite you to start at the very beginning of LFG, from the first page, and perhaps, with a little luck, you may enjoy what you find. Once you are caught up in the story, please return to LFGcomic.com for the continuing adventures.\n\nRegardless of where you go from here, thank you for taking the time and we hope to see you again soon.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31c3f6909bf7b2079111a05c70e9f4c70611456","amp;dn":"Looking+For+Group+books+1+through+26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31c3f6909bf7b2079111a05c70e9f4c70611456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,28,63,105,9,191,123,32,121,17,26,5,199,14,159,76,112,97,20,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
