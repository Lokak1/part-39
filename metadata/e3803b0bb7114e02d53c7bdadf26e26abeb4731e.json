Enjoy\n\nThe Legend of Lobo (1962) is a film about a family of wolves. There is no dialogue but, but it is narrated by Rex Allen. In contrast to other movies about wolves, this movie is very different. They are neither sugarcoated nor vilified, but rather are shown to be both an efficient predator and a devoted parent in times of encroaching human settlement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3803b0bb7114e02d53c7bdadf26e26abeb4731e","amp;dn":"Disney+Movie+-+The+Legend+of+Lobo+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3803b0bb7114e02d53c7bdadf26e26abeb4731e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,128,59,11,183,17,78,2,213,60,123,218,223,38,226,106,190,180,115,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
