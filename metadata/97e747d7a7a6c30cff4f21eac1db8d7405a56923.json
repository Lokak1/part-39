Hailing from all over Southern California, the twenty-somethings of TTC consider Huntington Beach, CA their home base. Orange County?with all its preliminary notions?is the breeding ground for many great bands and upcoming talent, but TTC does everything to defy these notions. TTC has remained self-sufficient by booking their own tours and acquiring their own sponsors (Paul Frank, Paer Clothing and Active Rideshop). TTC has shared the stage in a supporting role?often handpicked?by prominent bands such as, AFI, LostProphets, Eighteen Visions, Everytime I Die, Goldfinger and Saosin. Take The Crown has just finished recording their RISE Records release &quot;RELAPSE REACT&quot; with producer Kris Crummet, which is set to release May 13, 2008\n____________________________________________________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e747d7a7a6c30cff4f21eac1db8d7405a56923","amp;dn":"Take+The+Crown+-+Relapse+React+-+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e747d7a7a6c30cff4f21eac1db8d7405a56923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,231,71,215,167,166,195,12,255,79,33,234,193,219,141,116,5,165,105,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
