This album has been available on CD before, but this new Angel Air edition contains no less than 8 bonus tracks. The original LP was released on the well-known Vertigo label, which at the time were one of the most interesting labels for progressive rock. The value of the original LP has reached Ã‚Â£100.\n Their music is a blend of blues, jazz-rock and progressive rock with lots of nice Hammond organ. The band had a fantastic female vocalist in Linda Hoyle. AFFINITY started writing for a second album, but in January 1971 Linda left the band and that was the end for the whole band.\n\n If you're into 70's progressive rock this album should have its given place in your collection, and if you haven't already got it you should buy it immediately.\n\nprogarchives.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2fc077baa6546994f7b02553121db1ede5d543","amp;dn":"Affinity+-+Affinity%281970%2F2014%29+UK++Progressive-Rock+24bit%2F96khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2fc077baa6546994f7b02553121db1ede5d543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,47,192,119,186,166,84,105,148,247,176,37,83,18,29,177,237,229,213,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
