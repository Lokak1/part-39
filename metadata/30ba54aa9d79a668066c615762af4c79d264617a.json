Kontogeorgis and SÃ¸ren Kiil (Wiley, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781118881187\r\n\r\nColloid and Surface Chemistry is a subject of immense importance and implications both to our everyday life and numerous industrial sectors, ranging from coatings and materials to medicine and biotechnology.\r\nHow do detergents really clean? (Why canâ€™t we just use water ?) Why is milk â€œmilkyâ€ Why do we use eggs so often for making sauces ? Can we deliver drugs in better and controlled ways? Coating industries wish to manufacture improved coatings e.g. for providing corrosion resistance, which are also environmentally friendly i.e. less based on organic solvents and if possible exclusively on water. Food companies want to develop healthy, tasty but also long-lasting food products which appeal to the environmental authorities and the consumer. Detergent and enzyme companies are working to develop improved formulations which clean more persistent stains, at lower temperatures and amounts, to the benefit of both the environment and our pocket. Cosmetics is also big business! Creams, lotions and other personal care products are really just complex emulsions. All of the above can be explained by the principles and methods of colloid and surface chemistry. A course on this topic is truly valuable to chemists, chemical engineers, biologists, material and food scientists and many more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30ba54aa9d79a668066c615762af4c79d264617a","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Applied+Colloid+and+Surface+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30ba54aa9d79a668066c615762af4c79d264617a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,186,84,170,157,121,166,104,6,108,97,87,98,175,76,121,210,100,97,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
