Stories like a flicker into existence, pulled from their stasis in the digital landscape,  rendered in brilliant light on your computer screen, and after youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read them, the page turns and the diodes rearrange and the text is only so much electric vapor. We barely let these stories make an imprint on our lives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they take up no space, they demand no time, they require no upkeep. We read them in vacuum tubes of our own design and wonder why it can be so difficult to identify with the material. We wonder why it can be such a trial to find something new and intriguing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22852d1fa2b58e3cf4e2a211ba5d69a9b0fd2f32","amp;dn":"The+Bad+Dog+Book+Club","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22852d1fa2b58e3cf4e2a211ba5d69a9b0fd2f32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,133,45,31,162,181,142,60,244,226,162,17,186,93,105,169,176,253,47,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
