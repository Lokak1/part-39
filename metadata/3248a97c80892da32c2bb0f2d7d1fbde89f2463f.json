Bobby Peacock of the website says of the song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe lyrics alone are beautiful, with the narrator asking just why a special person in his life had to commit suicide. Perhaps the best line is 'Why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a very striking metaphor.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  The song also received special mention in Matt Bjorke original review of the Unstoppable album, where he wrote, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfor this album, &quot;Why&quot; the trio has found what might be their best album-ending track since their self-titled debut's &quot;I'm Moving On.&quot; Levox has NEVER sounded better vocally and sings the questioning lyrics that make up the Allen Shamblin and Rob Mathes song. The song finds a guy asking why a friend would choose to 'leave the stage in the middle of the song.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Chris Neal of Country Weekly gave it three stars out of five, saying that lead singer Gary LeVox &quot;handles the lyric as delicately as its subject matter[ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦] calls for&quot; but said that the &quot;climactic arena rock guitar solo[ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦]rob[s] some of the song of its intimacy.&quot;\n\nUnstoppable is the sixth studio album by the American country pop group Rascal Flatts.
