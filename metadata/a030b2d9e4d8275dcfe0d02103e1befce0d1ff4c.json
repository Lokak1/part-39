I carried on with\ndoing it for a while longer until I discovered, at the age\nof 20, the side of house music that still fascinates me:\nclub or tribal house.\n\nThe powerful vocals plus the absurd talent of such\nproducers as Thunderpuss, Junior Vasquez, Victor Calderone\nand others really made me disbelieve what I was listening.\n\nFrom that moment I truly found myself. I knew what I\nwanted. That was when I started learning more about the\nclub house genre and improving my musical knowledge. I've\nalways been computer-savvy, which also helped me a lot and\nallowed me to begin all the work you know today.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rafaellelis.com.br/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rafaellelis.com.br/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDownloaded from Lelis' official web site, including cover.\nNo reencodes.\n__________________________________________________\n\nncore releases\n38+: http://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo\n1-37: http://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a030b2d9e4d8275dcfe0d02103e1befce0d1ff4c","amp;dn":"Rafael_Lelis_Vs_Gloria_Estefan-Glorias_Salsa_%28Main_Private_Mix%29-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a030b2d9e4d8275dcfe0d02103e1befce0d1ff4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,48,178,217,228,216,39,93,207,224,208,33,3,225,190,252,224,209,255,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
