The trio were successful for most of their 40-plus years of recording\nmusic, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a pop act in the late\n1960s and early 1970s, and as a foremost act of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\nThe group sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognisable; Robin's clear\nvibrato lead was a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barrys RB falsetto became their\nsignature sound during the late 1970s and 1980s. The brothers co-wrote all of their own\nhits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.\n\n\n\n\n  01 - Three Kisses Of Love                         [01:49]\n  02 - Spicks And Specks                            [02:51]\n  03 - How Love Was True                            [02:51]\n  04 - How Many Birds                               [02:00]\n  05 - Wine And Women                               [02:55]\n  06 - I Was A Lover, A Leader Of Men               [03:34]\n  07 - Monday's Rain                                [03:00]\n  08 - I Am The World                               [02:36]\n  09 - To Be Or Not To Be                           [02:11]\n  10 - I Don't Think It's Funny                     [02:55]\n  11 - Turn Around, Look At Me                      [02:19]\n  12 - Second Hand People                           [02:05]\n  13 - Claustrophobia                               [02:15]\n  14 - Every Day I Have To Cry                      [02:08]\n  15 - Follow The Wind                              [02:12]\n  16 - Take Hold Of That Star                       [02:42]\n\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 40:01\nTotal Size...........: 205.89 MB\n\n\nRipper.......: EAC V1.0 beta 3, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC - 8 - oan\n\nCodec........: Free Lossless Audio Codec [FLAC]\n\nVersion......: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nQuality......: Lossless, [avg. compression: 51 %]\n\nChannels.....: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nTags.........: VorbisComment\n\nScand Artwork.........: @ 600dpi\n\nTraders Little Helper....: checksum Files .ffp &amp; .md5\n\nLyrics....: c/o EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan) on 23/10/2011\n\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 23/10/2011\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6857ef3cdfacb62a71db64f597962462b54992","amp;dn":"Bee+Gees+-+1963+-1966+2002+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6857ef3cdfacb62a71db64f597962462b54992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,104,87,239,60,223,172,182,42,113,219,100,245,151,150,36,98,181,73,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
