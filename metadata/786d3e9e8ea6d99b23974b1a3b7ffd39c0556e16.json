You can also remove the RPC region code, thereby making the movie region free and viewable on any DVD player and with any DVD player software. \n\nAnyDVD is capable of removing unwanted movie features, including subtitles and prohibition messages such as copyright and FBI warnings. It also allows you to launch an external application whenever you insert or remove a disc, or prevent 'PC-friendly' software from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD. \n\nDecryption is not all that AnyDVD offers. You can control the drive speed of your DVD drive, allowing you to reduce the noise level when watching movies on your PC. You can even adjust the display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays. \n\nBut AnyDVD doesn't just stop at DVDs, it also fixes intentionally broken audio CDs to allow you to play and copy them. \n\nFeatures\nWorks automatically in the background\nRemoves encryption (CSS) and region code (RPC) from DVDs\nRemoves analogue copy protection (Macrovision)\nRemoves features such as forced subtitles and warnings\nDecrypts without the need to save the data onto your hard-disk\nDecrypts 'on the fly'\nPrevents automatic launching of 'PC-friendly' software on video DVDs\nAllows adjustment of your monitor refresh rate for both NTSC and PAL monitors\nAllows execution of external programs on disc insertion and removal\nAllows speed control of your DVD drives\nCompatible with all DVD media\nWorks with all DVD-drives, regardless of region code\nWorks with all DVD copying, such as CloneDVD, and all DVD player software\nWorks transparently for the operating system: DVDs can be shared over the network and copied with the command prompt or with Windows Explorer, etc.\nProven to be stable and fast and does not require an ASPI driver\nProvides its own Universal Disk Format (UDF) reader.

The movies are copied 1:1 and therefore not modified (compressed). Note that to copy movie DVDs you also require AnyDVD. \n\nCloneCD also works with other formats such as ISO and UDF files and copies CDs/DVDs with the new SafeDisc 3 Copy Protection System.

If you, like most gamers, find it annoying looking for and inserting the CD-ROM for your favorite game each time you play it, then Game Jackal Pro is for you. \n\nKeeping your gaming investment safe: One major concern gamers have is the CD's life span. The CD-ROM for a popular game may be inserted and removed many hundreds of times, this of course leads to the inevitable &quot;Unable to read&quot; error and ultimately a trip to the trash. \n\nUnleash your games and go gaming &quot;cd free&quot; in seconds: Using Game Jackal Pro eliminates the need to insert the CD-ROM before playing your favorite title, therefore allowing you to fire up your favorite game in seconds. \n\nEasy to use: Game Jackal Pro provides the user with a powerful and easy to use interface to go gaming &quot;cd free&quot;. It does this without modifying any of your game's files or installing any virtual drives on your system. Simply select the game you want to play from the Game Jackal Pro interface, or create a desktop shortcut for even faster access. \n\nImage mode: Image mode adds support for games that need to stream data directly from the CD or DVD during game play. \n\nKeep young eyes from playing games that may be not right for them: Game Jackal Pro comes complete with a feature called Guardian Control, this feature allows restrictions to be placed on game profiles. \n\nYoung gamers can make short work of a game CD: Being able to pack away the game CD has proven to be extremely popular with parents of young gamers, where a game can be destroyed in weeks! \n\nThere's no other product like it: The simple fact is that Game Jackal Pro stands alone. There's no other product on the market that delivers the flexibility and functionality that Game Jackal Provides. \n\nGuardian Control \nOk... so Game Jackal Provides you with a way to protect game CD's from the little hands of a young gamer, but how do we then stop these same young gamers from playing games that may not be appropriate? \nGame Jackal Pro contains a very unique and powerful feature called Guardian Control, this allows a game profile to be password protected thereby ensuring that only specific users (i.e. those knowing the password) can play the game. And because your CD-ROM's are now put away for safe keeping, there's no fear of accidentally leaving a disc in the drive for a young gamer to find. \nSo now that we have limited what a young gamer can play, wouldn't it be great if we could limit when games could be played? Well once again Game Jackal Pro provides a way... Guardian Control also allows rules to be created that detail when and how long games can be played. These rules can be as simple as defining a time (i.e. between 6:30PM and 8:30PM) during the week days in which games can be played to complex rules that involve many periods in which a young person can go gaming. \nFeatures Pro Version\nCreate profiles right from the desktop with the new &quot;One-click&quot; profile creation option. Simply right-click any game icon on you desktop (or anywhere else for that matter) and select &quot;Convert to Game Jackal Profile&quot;, a much simplified creation wizard guides you through a 2 step process. \nUnused profiles can now be moved to an archive section allowing you to keep only your current favorites in the &quot;My Game Profile&quot; section. \nA new &quot;plug-in&quot; interface is now available, this allows third-party developers to create plug-ins for Game Jackal Pro. \nRight-click popup menu for profiles, this provides a faster and easier way to manage profiles. \nImproved reliability, support and performance for many games and hardware configurations. \nSupport for multi processor hardware, including the ability to specify processor(s) on each profile.\nImage mode, for games that need to stream data from the CD or DVD during game play. \nAn easy to use interface, providing the user with a single tool for &quot;cd free&quot; gaming. \nThe creation of a Game Jackal Profile is performed while you are playing your favorite game! \nUsing the auto update feature, your version of Game Jackal Pro will always be the latest version available. \nGuardian Control, this feature allows for the password protection of game profiles in addition to specifying when and how long a game can be played. \nNo longer do you need to find and insert the game's CD-ROM.\nPreserve the original game's CD-ROM: one of the problems with having a favorite game is that the CD-ROM gets damaged over time. \nGame load times are dramatically shortened\nSystem Requirements\nIBM-compatible PC with a minimum 500 MHz Pentium-class microprocessor and 64 MB RAM\nWindows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit)\n2 MB hard-disk space\n[/code]\n\n[img]http://www.slysoft.com/img/boxshots/boxshot_gamejackal-enterprise.gif[/img]\n\n[code]Game Jackal Enterprise has become the gaming tool of choice for cybercafes! Cybercafe owners and managers stand arm in arm with the private gaming community when it comes to no CD gaming. \n\nProtection of their gaming investment, convenience of use and small hard drive footprint are cited as the main reasons for moving to the Game Jackal product. Given the growing popularity of Game Jackal Enterprise within the world-wide cybercafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© community it was inevitable that we would develop an Enterprise Edition of this great product. The Enterprise Edition of Game Jackal has all the features of the basic product plus some fantastic additions to enhance the manageability of a no CD gaming environment for cybercafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© owners. Enterprise Edition seemlessly integrates with other third-party launchers and cyber-cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© applications such as SmartLaunch and CyberCafe Enterprise. \nFeatures Enterprise Version\nAll the features of the basic product plus some fantastic additions.\nAutomatic distribution of game profiles to client machines. \nRemote game activation (and deactivation). \nNo virtual drives required.\nGame Jackal Enterprise can run silently on client machines as a Windows service providing greater compatibility with cybercafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© launching software such as Smartlaunch and CybercafePro. \nHas been developed and tested with third-party launchers such as Smartlaunch and CyberCafe Pro.\nSystem Requirements\nWindows network environment\nIBM-compatible client PCs with a minimum 500 MHz Pentium-class microprocessor and 64 MB RAM\nWindows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit)\n2 MB hard-disk space\n[/code]\n\nWarning: Some antivirus may find patches are infected but they are all false positive. They only modify some code in order to activate apps.\n[img]http://img44.imageshack.us/img44/1940/jcvo6065.png[/img]\n\n\n[color=deepskyblue][size=5]You can download only those files you need also!
