Written with the studentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s background and ability in mind the book takes an innovative approach to quantum mechanics by combining the essential elements of the theory with the practical applications: it is therefore both a textbook and a problem solving book in one self-contained volume. Carefully structured, the book starts with the experimental basis of quantum mechanics and then discusses its mathematical tools. Subsequent chapters cover the formal foundations of the subject, the exact solutions of the SchrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶dinger equation for one and three dimensional potentials, time-independent and time-dependent approximation methods, and finally, the theory of scattering.\n\nThe text is richly illustrated throughout with many worked examples and numerous problems with step-by-step solutions designed to help the reader master the machinery of quantum mechanics.
