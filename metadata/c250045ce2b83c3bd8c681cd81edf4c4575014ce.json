(2014)\n\n\n\nDURATION: 1 HOUR\nOver the last few years, our weather in Britain has become more extreme.\n\nLast winter was the wettest ever recorded, as deadly storms battered the country for weeks on end. But previous winters have seen bitter lows of -22, as Britain was plunged into a deep freeze.\n\nWhat everyone wants to know now is: why is our weather getting more extreme, can we expect to see more of it in the future, and has it got anything to do with climate change?\n\nIn this episode of Horizon, physicist Dr Helen Czerski and meteorologist John Hammond make sense of Britain's recent extreme weather and discover that there is one thing that connects all our recent extreme winters - the jet stream, an invisible river of air that powers along 10 km above us. What's worrying is that recently it has been behaving rather strangely.\n\nScientists are now trying to understand what is behind these changes in the jet stream. Helen and John find out if extreme winters are something we may all have to get used to in the future.\n\nBBC\n\n\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 1 013 MB\nDuration (ms) : 59mn 4s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String : Variable\nTotal bitrate : 2 399 Kbps\n\n===================== Video =====================\nFormat : AVC\nFormat info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8bc3e2ece3cbc7bfa5ba&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nUse of CABAC : Yes\nRefFrames : 2 frames\nCodec Id : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration (ms) : 59mn 4s\nBitrate mode : Variable\nBitrate maximum : 3 500 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nAspect ratio : 16:9\nFramerate mode : Constant\nFramerate : 25.000 fps\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat : AAC\nFormat info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec Id : A_AAC\nDuration (ms) : 59mn 4s\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannelPositions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nEncoded by : RMAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c250045ce2b83c3bd8c681cd81edf4c4575014ce","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+What%27s+Wrong+with+Our+Weather+%282014%29+HDTV+RMAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c250045ce2b83c3bd8c681cd81edf4c4575014ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,80,4,92,226,184,60,59,216,198,129,205,129,237,244,196,87,80,20,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
