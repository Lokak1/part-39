After\nreleasing his Black Album Jay-Z announced his\nretirement from rapping although he has been heard\non numerous guest appearances with songs such as\nBeyonce&amp;#039;s Deja Vu, and many speculate that a new\nalbum could be on its way. But for the moment this\nGreatest Hits collection should be enough to keep\nyou going!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62a551ecbe7912576ffb373c063ed658cbd9067","amp;dn":"Jay-Z-Greatest_Hits-2006-uF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62a551ecbe7912576ffb373c063ed658cbd9067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,42,85,30,203,231,145,37,118,255,179,115,192,99,237,101,140,189,144,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
