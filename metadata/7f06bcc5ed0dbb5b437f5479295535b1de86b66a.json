A naÃƒÂ¯ve young secretary, fresh out of Cleveland, tumbles headlong into a brave new world of laundromat Lotharios, pot-growing landladies, cut throat debutantes, and Jockey Shorts dance contests. The saga that ensues is manic, romantic, tawdry, touching, and outrageous - unmistakably the handiwork of Armistead Maupin.\n\n[b]MORE TALES OF THE CITY - Narrated by Barbara Rosenblat[/b]\n\nThe divinely human comedy that began with Tales of the City rolls recklessly along as Michael Tolliver pursues his favourite gynaecologist, Mona Ramsey uncovers her roots in a desert whorehouse, and Mary Ann Singleton finds love at sea with the amnesiac of her dreams.\n\n[b]FURTHER TALES OF THE CITY - Narrated by Barbara Rosenblat[/b]\n\nThe residents of 28 Barbary Lane are back again in this racy, suspenseful and wildly romantic sequel to Tales of the City and More Tales of the City. DeDe Halcyon-Day and Mary Ann Singleton track down a charismatic psychopath, Michael Tolliver looks for love, landlady Anna Madrigal imprisons an anchorwoman in her basement storeroom, and Armistead Maupin is in firm control. \n\nThis version is unredacted, in the book all references to Rock Hudson, Jim Nabors &amp; Doris Day were redacted and replaced by underscores. This audiobook version does away with such coyness.\n\nNot my rips, but I have listened to all of them and they are glitch free.\n\nShare and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f06bcc5ed0dbb5b437f5479295535b1de86b66a","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+City+Omnibus%3A+Vol+1+-+Armistead+Maupin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f06bcc5ed0dbb5b437f5479295535b1de86b66a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,6,188,197,237,13,187,91,67,127,84,121,41,85,53,177,222,134,182,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
