Even if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just random stuff, nothing important, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re important to me. Gramps is great, and I love working on the ranch. ButÃ¢â‚¬Â¦IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lonely. I feel disconnected, like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m no one, like I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t belong anywhere. Like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just here until something else happens. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know what I want with my future. But your letters, they make me feel connected to something, to someone. I had a crush on you, when we first met. I thought you were beautiful. So beautiful. It was hard to think of anything else. Then camp ended and we never got together, and now all I have of you is these letters. S**t. I just told you I have a crush on you. HAD. Had a crush. Not sure what is anymore. A letter-crush? A literary love? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stupid. Sorry. I just have this rule with myself that I never throw away what I write and I always send it, so hopefully this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t weird you out too much. I had a dream about you too. Same kind of thing. Us, in the darkness, together. Just us. And it was like you said, a memory turned into a dream, but a memory of something thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never happened, but in the dream it felt so real, and it was more, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know, more RIGHT than anything IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever felt, in life or in dreams. I wonder what it means that we both had the same dream about each other. Maybe nothing, maybe everything. You tell me.\n\nCade\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\nCade,\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pen pals. Maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever be. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know. If we met IRL (in real life, in case youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not familiar with the term) what would happen? And just FYI, the term you used, a literary love? It was beautiful. So beautiful. That term means something, between us now. We are literary loves. Lovers? I do love you, in some strange way. Knowing about you, in these letters, knowing your hurt and your joys, it means something so important to me, that I just canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t describe. I need your art, and your letters, and your literary love. If we never have anything else between us, I need this. I do. Maybe this letter will only complicate things, but like you I have a rule that I never erase or throw away what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written and I always send it, no matter what I write in the letter. \n\nYour literary love,\n\nEver","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b83efc712868212369c89152ee6944964f69fd9","amp;dn":"Jasinda+Wilder_Forever+%26amp%3B+Always+%28Ever+Trilogy+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b83efc712868212369c89152ee6944964f69fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,131,239,199,18,134,130,18,54,156,137,21,46,230,148,73,100,246,159,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
