Joined by Mingus\nBig Band bassist Boris Kozlov and veteran drummer Billy Hart, Pilc mixes\ncreative arrangements of several familiar songs with his demanding\noriginals. His take of Cole Porter's &quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot; is full of\nhumor (adding a quick dash of &quot;You and the Night in the Music&quot;) while retaining\na sensual undercurrent and a sense of adventure with his wild variations, with\npotent solos all around. Pilc's adaptation of &quot;Try to Remember&quot; (from the\nlong-running Broadway musical The Fantastiks) incorporates dissonant bass chords\nand several twists that keep it from getting overly sentimental, while the\nhaunting &quot;Relic&quot; is a reworking of a Franz Schubert theme. The high point of\nPilc's compositions is his five-part suite &quot;True Story,&quot; which incorporates many\ncontrasting styles in its brief segments. Although many jazz journalists have\nhigh regard for the work of Jean-Michel Pilc, he remains a treasure awaiting\ndiscovery by many American jazz fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:748c83b734d07aa425c31c1246206a03a771a5c4","amp;dn":"Jean-Michel+Pilc+-+True+Story+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"748c83b734d07aa425c31c1246206a03a771a5c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,140,131,183,52,208,122,164,37,195,28,18,70,32,106,3,167,113,165,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
