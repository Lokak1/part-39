It seems that something happen with my last torrent upload and many peers were stuck in 99.9 percent. The only solution to seed was skip the files that had not been downloaded and then you would seed. \n\nWhy this happened? \nI have no idea, i hope it doesn't happen again to any of my uploads. \n\nDo i have to download this?\nWith my previous upload you should have everything you need but if something is not working. Yes download this.\n\nThen what?\nThen copy and paste the content inside the folder to your Starcraft II directory and play.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7481711/Starcraft_2_Full___amp_amp__Portable&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7481711/Starcraft_2_Full___amp_amp__Portable&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62e4317fce231d08e9c904331c87c4af551d517e","amp;dn":"Starcraft+2+Full+Portable+Missing+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62e4317fce231d08e9c904331c87c4af551d517e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,228,49,127,206,35,29,8,233,201,4,51,28,135,196,175,85,29,81,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
