These include biopesticides, such as bacteria for the control of plant diseases, and biofertilizer to improve crop productivity and quality. Especially plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are as effective as pure chemicals in terms of plant growth enhancement and disease control, in addition to their ability to manage abiotic and other stresses in plants. The various facets of these groups of bacteria are treated in this Microbiology Monograph, with emphasis on their emergence in agriculture. Further topics are Bacillus species that excrete peptides and lipopeptides with antifungal, antibacterial and surfactant activity, plant-bacteria-environment interactions, mineral-nutrient exchange, nitrogen assimilation, biofilm formation and cold-tolerant microorganisms.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 466 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (September 17, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642136117\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642136115","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c35a5d6397bd8fcfd57026d2c06f852355ff24d","amp;dn":"Plant+Growth+and+Health+Promoting+Bacteria+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c35a5d6397bd8fcfd57026d2c06f852355ff24d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,53,165,214,57,123,216,252,253,87,2,109,44,6,248,82,53,95,242,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
