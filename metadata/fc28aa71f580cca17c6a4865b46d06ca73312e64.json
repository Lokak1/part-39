The film was shot throughout Canada and United States including: Nevada, California, Oregon, Idaho, British Columbia and Washington. The idea for the name originated from an 1852 Matthew Arnold poem entitled &quot;The Buried Life&quot;.\n\nOn April 18, 2009 an article in The New York Times announced that a serial television version of their documentary entited &quot;The Buried Life&quot; was chosen by MTV for development. The show has been selected as a flagship reality program that will usher in MTV's shift away from the superficial content currently dominating the network's programming towards the production of more socially conscious media. The network has ordered eight weekly half-hour episodes.\n\n---\n\nSource by Dvsky, cropping fixed, direct stream copy + 2-pass compression.\n\n   General\n\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 148 MiB\n      Duration : 21mn 2s\n      Overall bit rate : 984 Kbps\n\n   Video\n\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 21mn 2s\n      Bit rate : 847 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 330 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.891\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.172\n      Stream size : 128 MiB (86%)\n      Writing library : XviD 50\n\n   Audio\n\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 21mn 2s\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 124 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 18.6 MiB (13%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc28aa71f580cca17c6a4865b46d06ca73312e64","amp;dn":"The+Buried+Life+S01E02+WS+DSR+Xvid-Dodecahedron+%5BDodecahedron%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc28aa71f580cca17c6a4865b46d06ca73312e64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,40,170,113,245,128,204,161,124,106,72,101,180,109,6,202,115,49,46,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
