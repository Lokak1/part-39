Marzluff\n2014 | ISBN: 0300197071 | English | 320 pages | PDF | 6 MB\n\nWelcome to Subirdia presents a surprising discovery: the suburbs of many large cities support incredible biological diversity. Populations and communities of a great variety of birds, as well as other creatures, are adapting to the conditions of our increasingly developed world. In this fascinating and optimistic book, John Marzluff reveals how our own actions affect the birds and animals that live in our cities and towns, and he provides ten specific strategies everyone can use to make human environments friendlier for our natural neighbors.\n\nOver many years of research and fieldwork, Marzluff and student assistants have closely followed the lives of thousands of tagged birds seeking food, mates, and shelter in cities and surrounding areas. From tiny Pacific wrens to grand pileated woodpeckers, diverse species now compatibly share human surroundings. By practicing careful stewardship with the biological riches in our cities and towns, Marzluff explains, we can foster a new relationship between humans and other living creaturesÃ¢â‚¬â€one that honors and enhances our mutual destiny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8de24aca8728238add44ad0f76333bb5d3fabca9","amp;dn":"Welcome+to+Subirdia%3A+Sharing+Our+Neighborhoods+with+Wrens%2C+Robin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8de24aca8728238add44ad0f76333bb5d3fabca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,226,74,202,135,40,35,138,221,68,173,15,118,51,59,181,211,250,188,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
