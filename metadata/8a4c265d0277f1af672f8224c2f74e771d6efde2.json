As different techniques are introduced, sample problems and application sections demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to actual risk management problems. Exercises at the end of each chapter and the accompanying solutions at the end of the book allow readers to practice the techniques they are learning and monitor their progress. A companion Web site includes interactive Excel spreadsheet examples and templates.\n\nMathematics and Statistics for Financial Risk Management is an indispensable reference for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s financial risk professional.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface ix\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in the Second Edition xi\n\nAcknowledgments xiii\n\nChapter 1 Some Basic Math 1\n\nLogarithms 1\n\nLog Returns 2\n\nCompounding 3\n\nLimited Liability 4\n\nGraphing Log Returns 5\n\nContinuously Compounded Returns 6\n\nCombinatorics 8\n\nDiscount Factors 9\n\nGeometric Series 9\n\nProblems 14\n\nChapter 2 Probabilities 15\n\nDiscrete Random Variables 15\n\nContinuous Random Variables 15\n\nMutually Exclusive Events 21\n\nIndependent Events 22\n\nProbability Matrices 22\n\nConditional Probability 24\n\nProblems 26\n\nChapter 3 Basic Statistics 29\n\nAverages 29\n\nExpectations 34\n\nVariance and Standard Deviation 39\n\nStandardized Variables 41\n\nCovariance 42\n\nCorrelation 43\n\nApplication: Portfolio Variance and Hedging 44\n\nMoments 47\n\nSkewness 48\n\nKurtosis 51\n\nCoskewness and Cokurtosis 53\n\nBest Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) 57\n\nProblems 58\n\nChapter 4 Distributions 61\n\nParametric Distributions 61\n\nUniform Distribution 61\n\nBernoulli Distribution 63\n\nBinomial Distribution 65\n\nPoisson Distribution 68\n\nNormal Distribution 69\n\nLognormal Distribution 72\n\nCentral Limit Theorem 73\n\nApplication: Monte Carlo Simulations\n\nPart I: Creating Normal Random Variables 76\n\nChi-Squared Distribution 77\n\nStudentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s t Distribution 78\n\nF-Distribution 79\n\nTriangular Distribution 81\n\nBeta Distribution 82\n\nMixture Distributions 83\n\nProblems 86\n\nChapter 5 Multivariate Distributions and Copulas 89\n\nMultivariate Distributions 89\n\nCopulas 97\n\nProblems 111\n\nChapter 6 Bayesian Analysis 113\n\nOverview 113\n\nBayesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Theorem 113\n\nBayes versus Frequentists 119\n\nMany-State Problems 120\n\nContinuous Distributions 124\n\nBayesian Networks 128\n\nBayesian Networks versus Correlation Matrices 130\n\nProblems 132\n\nChapter 7 Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals 135\n\nSample Mean Revisited 135\n\nSample Variance Revisited 137\n\nConfidence Intervals 137\n\nHypothesis Testing 139\n\nChebyshev's Inequality 142\n\nApplication: VaR 142\n\nProblems 152\n\nChapter 8 Matrix Algebra 155\n\nMatrix Notation 155\n\nMatrix Operations 156\n\nApplication: Transition Matrices 163\n\nApplication: Monte Carlo Simulations\n\nPart II: Cholesky Decomposition 165\n\nProblems 168\n\nChapter 9 Vector Spaces 169\n\nVectors Revisited 169\n\nOrthogonality 172\n\nRotation 177\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis 181\n\nApplication: The Dynamic Term Structure of Interest Rates 185\n\nApplication: The Structure of Global Equity Markets 191\n\nProblems 193\n\nChapter 10 Linear Regression Analysis 195\n\nLinear Regression (One Regressor) 195\n\nLinear Regression (Multivariate) 203\n\nApplication: Factor Analysis 208\n\nApplication: Stress Testing 211\n\nProblems 212\n\nChapter 11 Time Series Models 215\n\nRandom Walks 215\n\nDrift-Diffusion Model 216\n\nAutoregression 217\n\nVariance and Autocorrelation 222\n\nStationarity 223\n\nMoving Average 227\n\nContinuous Models 228\n\nApplication: GARCH 230\n\nApplication: Jump-Diffusion Model 232\n\nApplication: Interest Rate Models 232\n\nProblems 234\n\nChapter 12 Decay Factors 237\n\nMean 237\n\nVariance 243\n\nWeighted Least Squares 244\n\nOther Possibilities 245\n\nApplication: Hybrid VaR 245\n\nProblems 247\n\nAppendix A Binary Numbers 249\n\nAppendix B Taylor Expansions 251\n\nAppendix C Vector Spaces 253\n\nAppendix D Greek Alphabet 255\n\nAppendix E Common Abbreviations 257\n\nAppendix F Copulas 259\n\nAnswers 263\n\nReferences 303\n\nAbout the Author 305\n\nAbout the Companion Website 307\n\nIndex 309\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nMichael B.
