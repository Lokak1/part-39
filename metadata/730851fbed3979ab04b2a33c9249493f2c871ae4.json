Now the distinctive silhouette of the Stealth Fighter (it&amp;#039;s actually a bomber) has been sighted in the FSX/FS2004 skies and is ready for any covert operations that you need to undertake. This incredible aircraft can go pretty much where it pleases and fly undetected thanks to its bizarre shape. Known as the Stealth Fighter, it&amp;#039;s actually a bomber and has been deployed successfully in many theatres of war ever since the first secret flights in the early 1980s. Now the team at CLS has brought this amazing machine to Flight Simulator and armchair pilots can now join the airborne elite and take the Nighthawk anywhere they want in the FS world\n\nHappy Flying :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:730851fbed3979ab04b2a33c9249493f2c871ae4","amp;dn":"FS2004%2FFSX+JustFlight+F-117A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"730851fbed3979ab04b2a33c9249493f2c871ae4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,8,81,251,237,57,121,171,4,178,163,60,146,73,73,63,44,135,26,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
