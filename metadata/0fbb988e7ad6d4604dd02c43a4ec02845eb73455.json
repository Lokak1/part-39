Enter Chrissy (Chrysanthemum) Everstar: SavannahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gum-chewing, cell phoneÃ¢â‚¬â€œcarrying, high heel-wearing Fair Godmother. Showing why sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only FairÃ¢â‚¬â€because sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a very good fairy studentÃ¢â‚¬â€Chrissy mistakenly sends Savannah back in time to the Middle Ages, first as Cinderella, then as Snow White. Finally she sends Tristan, a boy in SavannahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s class, back instead to turn him into her prom-worthy prince. When Savannah returns to the Middle Ages to save Tristan, they must team up to defeat a troll, a dragon, and the mysterious and undeniably sexy Black Knight. Laughs abound in this clever fairy tale twist from a master of romantic comedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fbb988e7ad6d4604dd02c43a4ec02845eb73455","amp;dn":"My+Fair+Godmother+-+Janette+Rallison.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fbb988e7ad6d4604dd02c43a4ec02845eb73455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,187,152,142,122,214,212,96,77,208,44,67,164,236,2,132,94,183,52,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
