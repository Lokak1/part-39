The authors of this up-to-date compendium on pericardial disease etiology, diagnostics and treatment, Professors Bernhard Maisch (Marburg), Arsen Ristic (Belgrade), Petar Seferovic (Belgrade) and Teresa Tsang (Rochester) focus on recent advances to the new window that has been opened to the heart by flexible and video-assisted pericardioscopy, modern biochemical, immunohistological and molecular tools for the analysis of epicardial and pericardial biopsies, which have been acquired safely under pericardioscopic control by the interventional pericardiologist. Their book adds brand-new information to the recent and so far only guidelines world-wide by the European Society of Cardiology on the management of pericardial diseases. This task-force has been chaired by the lead author B. Maisch.
