All Add-ons are tested by me personally with RailWorks2 v117.3a and works great! If you want to \ndownload RailWorks, I advise you to download the &quot;RailWorks.2-SKIDROW&quot; torrent here on the TPB which is version v114.0b and \nupdate it with the upgrade in this torrent, that works fine for me. \nIt's possible that the files also works with an older version of RailWorks or even with RailSimulator, but I hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t test that \nso I can't guarantee anything.\nSome of these Add-ons works also on a legal version of RailWorks, but please note that every time Steam updates RailWorks, the\nAssets that comes with RailWorks will be overwritten, so most of RSDL Add-ons don't work on legal versions! \nHave fun with it!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to install?\nAt first extract the *.rar file with WinRar or something else, then there are two options:\n-   *.rar file contains a *.rwp file; Install this using the Package Manager in Railworks by pressing &quot;Install&quot; in the &quot;Package\n    Manager&quot; tab and select the extracted *.rwp file, RailWorks will install the Assets now, if ask, overwrite existing Assets.\n-   *.rar file contains &quot;Assets&quot; and/or &quot;Content&quot; and/or some other folders; copy the folders to the main folder of RailWorks\n    for example &quot;C:\\Program Files\\RailSimulator.com\\RailWorks 2&quot;, if ask overwrite existing folders and files.\nNow you can use the installed Add-on in RailWorks, sometimes it's needed that you delete all &quot;Blueprint.pak&quot; files in the \nsubfolders of the &quot;Assets&quot; directory to show up the installed Add-ons!\n\nNote: With some files there is an Readme.txt enclosed, please read that file carefully for installation instructions!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes:\n&quot;Railworks 2 v117.3a.rar&quot; updates EVERY version of RailWorks to version 117.3!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you like this torrent, please leave a comment!\nPLEASE seed at least as much as you've downloaded so everyone can enjoy this Add-ons!\n\nMany thanks to all users that have ever uploaded RailWorks Add-ons!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b018d7aa5bee4ea3ae47b603ef5611057e7462","amp;dn":"Railworks+Add-ons+2011+-+Part+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b018d7aa5bee4ea3ae47b603ef5611057e7462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,176,24,215,170,91,238,78,163,174,71,182,3,239,86,17,5,126,116,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
