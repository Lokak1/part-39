Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice is the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom. It wasn't until the lush ballad &quot;Linger&quot; became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of &quot;Linger,&quot; the Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles. By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, they had added distorted guitars to their sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nRoses is the Cranberries' sixth album and first studio effort in over ten years following the band's 2001 album Wake Up and Smell the Coffee. Recorded in Toronto in 2011, the album features production from longtime producer Stephen Street, who worked on Wake Up as well as the band's 1993 debut Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? and 1994's No Need to Argue. Set for release in 2012, the album includes the singles &quot;Show Me the Way&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Conduct\n02.Tomorrow\n03.Fire And Soul\n04.Raining\n05.Losing My Mind\n06.Schizophrenic Playboy\n07.Waiting\n08.Show Me The Way\n09.Astral Projection\n10.So Good\n11.Roses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ***Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbcb9f45f2e6860e0c7613468ae83af047e6663","amp;dn":"The+Cranberries+-+Roses+%282012%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dbcb9f45f2e6860e0c7613468ae83af047e6663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,188,185,244,95,46,104,96,224,199,97,52,104,174,131,175,4,126,102,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
