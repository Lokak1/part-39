What is it?\n --------------\n\n nullDC is a plugin based Dreamcast emulator for x86 based computers running Windows Operating Systems.\n\n\n 2. System Requirements\n ----------------------\n\n   Minimum      :\n\n   - Cpu        : Any CPU that supports SSE1 (AMD Athlon XP and later, Intel Pentium 3 and later)\n\n   - Video Card : DirectX9 compliant video card with Projected Textures support. (Geforce MX, ATi Radeon)\n\n   - Ram        : 256 MB\n\n   - OS         : Windows 2000/XP/2003\n\n   - December Redistributable of DirectX 9c. Latest version as of now can be found here:\n\tOnline Installer:\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&amp;DisplayLang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&amp;DisplayLang=en&lt;/a&gt;\n\tOffline Installer:\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c1367bc3-4676-481a-bfaa-5c15d1d7199d&amp;DisplayLang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c1367bc3-4676-481a-bfaa-5c15d1d7199d&amp;DisplayLang=en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   - VisualC++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Runtimes. They can be found here:\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=200B2FD9-AE1A-4A14-984D-389C36F85647&amp;displaylang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=200B2FD9-AE1A-4A14-984D-389C36F85647&amp;displaylang=en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   - winpcap. It's needed for modem emulation and it's not required otherwise. It can be found here:\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n   The above requirements are considered as the absolute minimum in order to run the emulator with just a few errors\n   as long as the selected plugins/options are supported by the hardware. The emulator is expected to malfunction\n   or to not work at all on systems that don't meet these requirements.\n\n\n   Recommended  :\n\n   - CPU        : AMD 3000+ or Intel Pentium 4 at 2.6GHz or equivalent.\n\n   - Video Card : DirectX9 compliant video card With shader model 2 support. (Geforce FX, ATi Radeon 9600)\n\n   - RAM        : 512MB Dual channel DDR333\n\n   Systems that meet the recommended requirements should get acceptable speeds for most games with minimal errors.\n\n\n   Ideal        :\n\n   - CPU        : Fast Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD 4000+ or equivalent.\n\n   - Video Card : DirectX9 compliant video card With shader model 4 support. (Geforce 8 series, Radeon HD series)\n\n   - RAM        : 1GB Dual channel DDR400\n\n   Systems that meet the ideal requirements should get full speed for most games using even the most demanding options.\n\n\n Notes:\n\n   - Some games have higher requirements than the rest and have speed issues even on systems that meet \n     the recommended requirements. In that case a system close to the ideal requirements is necessary to reach full speed.\n\n   - Pentium 4 CPUs perform some tasks slower than other CPUs, thus the clock speed of 2.6GHz is needed.\n     On the other hand, Pentium M CPUs perform the same tasks much faster\n     (A Pentium M 750 at 1.86GHz should be enough to reach full speed).\n     Intel Celeron and AMD Duron CPUs are slow and it's expected to perform worse than the rest.\n\n   - nullDC will run on Windows Vista. However, hardware requirements will be a bit higher than the ones mentioned\n     above and there will probably be sound related issues (as with many other applications running on Vista).\n\n\nI have also included the dreamcast bios with this release, so it is ready too use!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba96f79d9de28c4216a16fe387aba7841e5c39c6","amp;dn":"Dreamcast+Emulator+-+nullDC+v1.0.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba96f79d9de28c4216a16fe387aba7841e5c39c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,150,247,157,157,226,140,66,22,161,111,227,135,171,167,132,30,92,57,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
