It was reissued in 1996 on CD as New Tijuana Moods with four alternate takes. 2-CD expanded versions with further alternate takes were issued by RCA in 2000 and by Columbia in 2010.\n\nIt is notable that the name &quot;Charlie Mingus&quot; appears on the cover of the original album. Mingus hated all nicknames derived from Charles (&quot;Don't call me Charlie; that's not a man's name, that's a name for a horse&quot;.
