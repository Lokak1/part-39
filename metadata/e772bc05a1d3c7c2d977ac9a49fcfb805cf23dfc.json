Frame, Eileen M. Skelly George M. Frame II \n\nCompletely rewritten, revised, and updated, this Sixth Edition reflects the latest technologies and applications in spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chromatography. It illustrates practices and methods specific to each major chemical analytical technique while showcasing innovations and trends currently impacting the field. \n\nWith many scientific degrees covering various areas of instrumental analysis it is always difficult to find one book that can cover all the subjects required, but this book certainly does.\n\nMany of the chapters have been individually reviewed by teaching professors and include descriptions of the fundamental principles underlying each technique, demonstrations of the instrumentation, and new problem sets and suggested experiments appropriate to the topic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e772bc05a1d3c7c2d977ac9a49fcfb805cf23dfc","amp;dn":"Undergraduate+Instrumental+Analysis%2C+Sixth+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e772bc05a1d3c7c2d977ac9a49fcfb805cf23dfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,114,188,5,161,211,199,194,217,119,172,154,73,252,251,128,92,242,61,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
