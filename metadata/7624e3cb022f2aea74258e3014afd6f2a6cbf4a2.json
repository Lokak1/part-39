It exposes the most vital and venomous sources of terror organizations.\n\nIn this latest edition, Dr. Ehrenfeld describes what it took to successfully challenge the lawsuit launched by a Saudi financier of Al-Qaeda, as a weapon to silence her and others from exposing him and his ilk. Dr. Ehrenfeld's initiative and efforts led to the passage New York State's anti-libel tourism &quot;Rachel's Law&quot; and the SPEECH Act, signed into law in August  2010. These laws protect American writers and publishers in print and on the Internet from the enforcement of foreign libel judgements in the US.\n\nAuthor: Rachel Ehrenfeld\nPublisher: Multieducator Inc\nPublication Date: September 14, 2011\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7624e3cb022f2aea74258e3014afd6f2a6cbf4a2","amp;dn":"Rachel+Ehrenfeld+-+Funding+Evil%3A+How+Terrorism+is+Financed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7624e3cb022f2aea74258e3014afd6f2a6cbf4a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,36,227,203,2,47,42,234,116,37,142,48,20,175,214,242,166,203,244,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
