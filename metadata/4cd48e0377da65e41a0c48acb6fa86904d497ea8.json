The 135-pound matchup was officially announced during a press conference today.\n\nSugiyama returned to the win column after fighting to a disappointing Draw with Ji-Yeon Kim in November by stopping Mizuho Sato in just 75 seconds at Deep Jewels 3. Hashi stepped back into action this month following a two-year hiatus and she also fought to a two-round Draw against Kim.\n\nSugiyama (11-3-1) has not tasted defeat in more than three years and the talented karateka has recently established herself as an effective finisher with first-round TKO victories in three of her past four bouts. This past year, it was announced that Sugiyama would likely compete for the first Deep Jewels 135-pound title in early 2014, but a Majority Draw against MMA debutant Kim put those plans on hold. Undeterred, Sugiyama returned to the ring in February and battered Saho with punches en route to a first-round doctor stoppage win to regain her title contender status.\n\nHashi (14-4-1) brought an eight-fight winning streak into the first Strikeforce WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bantamweight Championship bout in February 2010. The Japanese veteran faced off against then-unbeaten Canadian standout Sarah Kaufman, but dropped a lacklustre Unanimous Decision after five rounds. She suffered subsequent defeats against Tara LaRosa and Ã¢â‚¬Å“AlphaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cat Zingano in regional title bouts and took a two-year break from fighting after defeating Roxanne Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Happy WarriorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Modafferi at Jewels: Ã¢â‚¬Å“18th Ring.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On March 9th, Hashi battled Kim to a Unanimous Draw at Road FC: Korea 2.\n\nIn addition to the inaugural title bout between Sugiyama and Hashi, Deep Jewels 4 will also feature a matchup between the returning Saori Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shooting StarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ishioka (12-7-0) and Satomi Ã¢â‚¬Å“SaramiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Takano (3-3-0). Ishioka has not fought in more than two years and she steps back into action after taking a break to start a family. Takano remains a top prospect on the Deep Jewels roster, but she is coming off of a close decision loss to former Jewels champ Naho Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sugi RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sugiyama at Deep Jewels 3.\n\nFull fight card:\n\nShizuka Sugiyama vs Takayo Hashi\nSaori Ishioka vs Satomi Takano\nMei Yamaguchi vs Yukiko Seki\nBrittany Decker vs Tomo Maesawa\nElla Wu vs Miura Ayaka\nNaomi Taniyama vs Yuko Takagi\nMaya Dobashi vs Shiori Hori\n\nDeep Jewels 4 takes place on May 18th at Shinjuku FACE in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n\nComplete name                            : Deep.Jewels.4.WEB.DL-Magnum.flv\nFormat                                   : Flash Video\nFile size                                : 881 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 10mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 756 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Ustream.Tv\nTagging application                      : Yet Another Metadata Injector for FLV - Version 1.8\n_videokeyframe_frequency                 : 240.000\n\nVideo\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;682a091b0d0401060d28245b4658&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : No\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 3 frames\nCodec ID                                 : 7\nDuration                                 : 1h 10mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 800 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nStandard                                 : NTSC\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.116\nStream size                              : 399 MiB (45%)\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 10\nDuration                                 : 1h 10mn\nBit rate                                 : 96.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 36.9 MiB (4%)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cd48e0377da65e41a0c48acb6fa86904d497ea8","amp;dn":"Deep.Jewels.4.WEB.DL-Magnum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cd48e0377da65e41a0c48acb6fa86904d497ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,212,142,3,119,218,101,228,26,12,72,172,182,250,134,144,77,73,126,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
