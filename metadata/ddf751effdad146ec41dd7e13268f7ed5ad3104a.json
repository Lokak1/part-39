But one of his father&amp;#039;s students, Lo Wei, challenges him for control of the school.\n\nOverview:\tHwang Chi Yin is famous for Cross Fist and Shapeless Leg. He has lots of understudies, but with just one son, Fei Hung, whom he pampers much. Among the understudies is a wanderer from Japan. He is smart and indulgent. Loved by his colleagues but not by Chi Yin as he finds the wanderer too cruel, too furious to learn Chinese kung fu. In order not to bring harm to people, he gives the wanderer money and sends him away. Thinking Chi Yin is biased over him, he leaves angrily.\n\nTime flies, when Fei Hung grows up. It is a popular pastime of cricket, fights, and others. All of a sudden, Chi Yin dies. Fei Hung is obliged to take over and run Po Chi Lam. As he is too young and inexperienced, his eldest colleague, Lo Wai, is discontented with him. He forces Fei Hung to give his seat to him with pretext of experience or he will use force. Fei Hung does not want to run Po Chi Lam, but for fun, he fights with Lo Wai and manages to defeat him.\n\nCast: \tChin Kar Lok  ||  Lam Ching Ying  ||  Ng Suet Man  ||  Suen Gwok Ming  ||  Kwan Hoi San  ||  Chan Siu Pang  ||  Kong Miu Deng","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf751effdad146ec41dd7e13268f7ed5ad3104a","amp;dn":"%5BKung+Fu%5D+Martial+Arts+Master+Wong+Fei+Hung+%281992%29+-+Rmvb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf751effdad146ec41dd7e13268f7ed5ad3104a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,247,81,239,253,173,20,110,196,29,215,225,50,104,247,237,90,211,16,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
