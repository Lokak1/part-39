I like this Steve Martin movie a lot better than the BBC-TV miniseries that inspired it; a story like this demands to bet set in America - some of whose beest talents are on display here. And anything by Dennis Potter is worth checking out.\n\nThis is a surprisingly dark story for Martin - it's a black comedy/social satire set in depression-era Chicago, featuring a vendor of sheet music who is so addicted to the cheap songs he sells that he confuses them with reality.\n\nThe idea is that when people in this dreary world have some flight of fancy, a dazzling song-and-dance number erupts on screen. Christopher Walken does an amazing strip-tease, who even knew the guy could dance? Bernadette Peters and Vernal Bagneris also srut their stuff.\n\n&quot;...it was arranged that they should vanish now and then - and you must PAY before you get them back again!&quot;\n\nRipped from tape, which explains the small picture. In segmented mpg format, will play on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776879e0bf4b02cf12d5a1c0a11fbc46108ea936","amp;dn":"Pennies+from+Heaven+%281981%29+Steve+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776879e0bf4b02cf12d5a1c0a11fbc46108ea936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,104,121,224,191,75,2,207,18,213,161,192,161,31,188,70,16,142,169,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
