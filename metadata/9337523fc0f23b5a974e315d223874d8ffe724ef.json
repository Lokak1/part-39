More than 50\nreleases made up of 23 albums, 24 compilations, 2\nEP's and several more projects in the pipeline.\nMore than thirty international and French artists,\nlabel parties organised in six different countries\naround the world, beautiful encounters, beautiful\nmoments, good memories, and some less good.\n\nThe label is still characterized by this\neverlasting determination to promote psytrance and\nall other musical aesthetics it shares common\nvalues with. Thanks to its unique 'associative\nmethod' and a solid role of musical explorer, it\nthrives on cultural diversity and the emergence of\nnew talents and concepts.\n\nA common desire to mark the occasion instigated\nthe Decade project; because 10 years, that\ndeserves a big party!\n\nThis compilation is divided in two parts; the\nfirst CD gathers ten exclusive titles, freshly\nproduced for the occasion. The second chapter is a\n'Best Of', a reverence to the old school,\nfeaturing a selection of tracks that played a\nspecial role during the label's active decade.\nMassive thanks to everyone who contributed to the\nproject throughout the years; enjoy your\nlistening!\n\nlink: www.hadra.net\n\nTracks\n\n#   track                             length\n\n01  Sysyphe - The Ice Witches          08:22\n02  Sleeping Forest - Aerium           06:37\n03  Secret Vibes - Maia                07:33\n04  LovPacT - In And Out               06:42\n05  Digidep - Spectral Garden          05:40\n06  Oddwave And Kokmok - What On Earth 07:59\n    Will It Take\n07  D_Root - Crash Report              07:35\n08  Sine Die - Digital Bassics         06:38\n09  The Space Bar - Reykjavic Air      05:46\n    Traffic\n10  Tweakers - Decadelic               06:55\n\n01  B.Brain - University Hospital      03:50\n02  Lakay - Sunny                      08:35\n03  Itchy And Scratchy - Drulk The     06:48\n    Rodent Knob\n04  Digital Talk - Audio Extremists    08:51\n05  Barak - Castle Freak               07:40\n06  Psysex Feat.

Send  an  email  to:\n            apply[at]groovemission.org\n\nGroup Notes\n\nWe are  on the block  for over  a decade  now and\nwe noticed that it is getting worse year by year.\nYears ago scene releases found  their way  to the\npublic via kinda slow p2p networks, DC++ hubs  or\nFXP-Pubs.  Nowadays  most stuff  gets spread  via\nFilehosters within a few minutes  or even seconds\nwhich is very sad to see!  We wonder why are some\ncrazy kids  doing this?   What is your intention?\n                   GET A LiFE!\n\nOf course we can understand  that people download\na CD to listen to it before buying. But please be\nhonest and buy it  if you really like it!  If you\ncall  yourself  a fan  then  you should  own  the\nreleases from your favorite artists  as original!\nIf  you  got  everything  as mp3 only you  should\nreflect  a bit more  about  the current situation\nin psytrance scene! Our beloved psytrance artists\naren't  popstars like  Madonna who earn thousands\nif not millions. Labels can be happy if they earn\nenough  money to cover all the production  costs!\nIf  this  continues that  way some artists (maybe\nyour #1 favorite!) will stop making music  and/or\nthe  production  of  CDs  will  stop  at  all and\neverything will be available  as digital download\nonly - but no download  can beat the warm &amp; fuzzy\nfeeling to hold a brand new CD from your favorite\nartist    or   label    in   your    own   hands!\n\nWe can't  repeat it  often enough,  the psytrance\nscene  is very small  and needs  your support. If\nyou LOVE this music (like we do), please BUY this\nmusic  or  VISIT some parties  (like we do)!  Our\nreleases are meant  for promotion  only - to give\nyou   a   sample   of    the   retail    product.\n\nNEVER FORGET - THiS iS NOT A COPY, iT'S JUST MP3!\n\nFurthermore we wanna say thanks to all the people\nwho made this  whole thing  happen,  in the past,\npresent and future.  And finally, we want to send\n greetings  to  all our  fellow  friends  within\n the    scene!   You   know    who    you   are!\n\nMUSiC WORTH LiSTENiNG iS MUSiC WORTH BUYiNG!!\n\ngroov[e]mission  2ooo - infinity!\n\nALL YOUR PSY ARE BELONG TO US!\n\nnfo update : o7-12-2o11\n\n* artwork by cpN of cRo in o4 *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9337523fc0f23b5a974e315d223874d8ffe724ef","amp;dn":"VA_-_Decade-Ten_Years_Of_Hadra_Records-2CD-2015-gEm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9337523fc0f23b5a974e315d223874d8ffe724ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,55,82,63,192,242,59,90,151,78,49,93,34,56,116,216,255,231,36,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
