Lee WarrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life as a neurosurgeon in a trauma center began to unravel long before he shipped off to serve the Air Force in Iraq in 2004. When he traded a comfortable if demanding practice in San Antonio, Texas, for a ride on a C-130 into the combat zone, he was already reeling from months of personal struggle.\n\nAt the 332nd Air Force Theater Hospital at Joint Base Balad, Iraq, Warren realized his experience with trauma was just beginning. In his 120 days in a tent hospital, he was trained in a different specialtyÃ¢â‚¬â€surviving over a hundred mortar attacks and trying desperately to repair the damages of a war that raged around every detail of every day. No place was safe, and the constant barrage wore down every possible defense, physical or psychological.\n\nOne day, clad only in a T-shirt, gym shorts, and running shoes, Warren was caught in the open while round after round of mortars shook the earth and shattered the air with their explosions, stripping him of everything he had been trying so desperately to hold on to.\n\nWarrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story is an example of how a person can go from a place of total loss to one of strength, courage, and victory. Whether you are in the midst of your own crisis of faith, failed relationship, financial struggle, or illness, you will be inspired to remember that how you respond determines whether you surviveÃ¢â‚¬â€spiritually, emotionally, and sometimes physically.\n\nIt is the beginning of a long journey home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d8bf691b1a35082372e95891552c0aeabc760f8","amp;dn":"No+Place+To+Hide+-+W.+Lee+Warren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d8bf691b1a35082372e95891552c0aeabc760f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,139,246,145,177,163,80,130,55,46,149,137,21,82,192,174,171,199,96,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
