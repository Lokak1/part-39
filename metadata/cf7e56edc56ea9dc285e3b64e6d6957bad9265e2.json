Here is some Chevelle! I really liked the album when it was newer and it was well used - in my car, my home, my friends houses - so my CD was pretty scratched to hell. Thanks to EAC though it sounds great (took several hours to rip with all the error correction going on).  Unfortunately I forgot to save the log file for this one so I took a screen shot of the EAC window with my Chevelle CD in the drive so you know this is straight from the Disc and no other nasty lossy formats in between :)  The log file did have quite a few &quot;suspicious positions&quot; listed when I was looking at it but I listened through half of the album(where most of them were located) after ripping and the only spot I could hear a defect was the very end of the first song. It &amp;#039;skips&amp;#039; twice during the fade out. Shouldn&amp;#039;t be too big of a deal.\n\nTrack List:\n01. Family System    [0:04:16.71]\n02. Comfortable Liar    [0:03:43.44]\n03.
