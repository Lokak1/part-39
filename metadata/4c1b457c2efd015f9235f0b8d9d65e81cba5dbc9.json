The lean, spidery guitar and organ riffs interwove with a  hypnotic menace, providing a seductive backdrop for Jim Morrison's captivating vocals and probing prose. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; was the cut that would top the charts and  establish the group as stars, but most of the rest of the album is just as  impressive, including some of their best songs: the propulsive &quot;Break On Through&quot; (their first single), the beguiling Oriental mystery of &quot;The Crystal Ship,&quot; the mysterious &quot;End of the Night,&quot; &quot;Take It As It Comes&quot; (one of several tunes besides &quot;Light My Fire&quot; that also had hit potential), and the stomping rock of &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Twentieth Century Fox.&quot; The eleven-minute Oedipal drama &quot;The End&quot; was the group at their most daring and, some would contend, overambitious. It was nonetheless a haunting cap to an album whose nonstop melodicism and dynamic tension would never be equaled by the group again, let alone bettered. \n \n  Track Listing....: \n 01.Break on through [02:29] \n (to the other side) \n 02.Soul kitchen [03:35] \n 03.The crystal ship [02:35] \n 04.Twentieth century fox [02:34] \n 05.Alabama song (whisky bar) [03:20] \n 06.Light my fire [07:08] \n 07.Back door man [03:34] \n 08.I looked at you [02:22] \n 09.End of the night [02:53] \n 10.Take it as it comes [02:17] \n 11.The end [11:42] \n ____ \n \n 44:29 min \n 67,4 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c1b457c2efd015f9235f0b8d9d65e81cba5dbc9","amp;dn":"The_Doors-The_Doors-%28Retail%29-1988-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c1b457c2efd015f9235f0b8d9d65e81cba5dbc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,27,69,124,46,253,1,95,146,53,240,184,217,214,94,129,203,165,219,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
