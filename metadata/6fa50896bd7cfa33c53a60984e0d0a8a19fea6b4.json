Underground cartoonist Kim Deitch has recruited his entire cast of siblings to produce a unique, all-new &quot;picto-fiction&quot; pocket book. Deitch's Pictorama leads off with Kim's comic &quot;The Sunshine Girl.&quot; Then it's time for Seth's prose short story &quot;Children of Aruf,&quot; about a man and his dog... in a world where dogs talk. Third up is &quot;Unlikely Hours,&quot; a paranoid picto-story about a conspiracy of sentient rats written by Seth and illustrated by Kim. Next comes &quot;The Golem,&quot; once again written by Seth and decorated with a series of superb pencil illustrations by Simon, a prose novella about the mythical Jewish monster/protector. Kim wraps with &quot;The Cop on the Beat, the Man in the Moon and Me,&quot; one last comic - this one autobiographical. The book features an introduction by the Academy Award-winning animator, cartoonist and illustrator Gene (Tom and Jerry) Deitch, who happens to be the proud father of the trio.\n\nOther books by the Kim and the rest of the Deitch clan...\n\nA Shroud for Waldo  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8584931/A_Shroud_For_Waldo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8584931/A_Shroud_For_Waldo&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBeyond the Pale  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8652799/Kim_Deitch_-_Beyond_The_Pale_Krazed_Comic_Stories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8652799/Kim_Deitch_-_Beyond_The_Pale_Krazed_Comic_Stories&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBoulevard of Broken Dreams  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8517375/Kim_Deitch_-_The_Boulevard_of_Broken_Dreams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8517375/Kim_Deitch_-_The_Boulevard_of_Broken_Dreams&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd don't forget to click on his name in the tags up above to get a look at all the undergrounds he's contributed to over the years.\t\t\n\nAlso, keep an eye out for Kim's new book, The Amazing, Enlightening And Absolutely True Adventures of Katherine Whaley, when you're out and about the shops and book stores.
