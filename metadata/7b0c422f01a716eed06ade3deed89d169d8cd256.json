They had a smokinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rhythm and horn section. This one was done in 1946. It spent 18 weeks on top of the R&amp;B charts, and peaked at number seven on the national chart. The band AND this song were a big hit with everyone. The tune is a jump blues, that was written by country songwriters Denver Darling, who was known as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“hillbillyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ songwriter and guitarist, and Vaughn Horton, who wrote a hit called Ã¢â‚¬Å“MockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bird HillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Milt Gabler, who ran Decca Records, and was Louis JordanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record producer. Even though the song came out in the 40Ã¢â‚¬Â²s, (a decade before rock and roll happened) itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a predecessor. And, because of all those wonderful influences of Country, Jazz and R&amp;B, in it, the record could be on the list for being one of the first rock and roll songs.\n \nTim Armstrong- Guitar, Vocals\nDave Brophy-Drums\nJoe McMahon- Bass\nRusty Scott-Piano\nMike Mele- Elec Guitar\nJohn Aruda-Sax\nScott Aruda-Trumpet\nJeff Gallindo- Trombone\nJohn Morrical- BG Vocal\nKevin Bivona- BG Vocal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0c422f01a716eed06ade3deed89d169d8cd256","amp;dn":"Choo+Choo+Ch%27Boogie+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0c422f01a716eed06ade3deed89d169d8cd256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,12,66,47,1,167,22,238,208,106,222,61,238,216,157,22,157,140,210,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
