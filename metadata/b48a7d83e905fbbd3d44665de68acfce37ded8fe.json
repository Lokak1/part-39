Every song on this album shows just how powerful and emotional Gary can be. And it just taps the surface. What other &quot;country&quot; singer could ever do &quot;La Boheme&quot; or &quot;Les Miserables?&quot; John Berry is close, but not entirely in the same league as Mr. Morris. His versions of &quot;Finishing Touches,&quot; &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;, &quot;The Love You Found in Me,&quot; and &quot;100% Chance of Rain&quot; are chill-inducing. He manages a little twang every now and then, to appease diehard country fans, but Gary is just too good to be called a &quot;country&quot; singer. The man can sing anything! This collection of hits should whet your appetite for more. IF you really appreciate an incredible voice, singing whatever they want, and doing it ALL so magnificently.[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Gary Morris - Hits (Warner 9 25581)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Gary Morris\nAlbum................: Hits (Warner 9 25581)\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1987\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 253kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
