It was subsequently alleged that during those tests, armed forces personnel and Indigenous Australians may have been exposed to nuclear fallout that may have affected their health. This led eventually to a major inquiry which attracted a lot of publicity, and ultimately a deal was struck with the United Kingdom to fund rehabilitation of the test site. Ground Zero was made immediately following this inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 718x434, 25.000 fps, 1839 Kbps, 01h36m12s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ny675r3a1/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jvs5u2i71/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/lc3oc7l3x/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/64norut99/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/kcddgi5y5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30893f0ee12591f99ec0e0a3a0dcb1d423c7949e","amp;dn":"Ground+Zero+%281987+-+Australia%29+atomic+conspiracy+action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30893f0ee12591f99ec0e0a3a0dcb1d423c7949e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,137,63,14,225,37,145,249,158,192,224,163,160,220,177,212,35,199,148,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
