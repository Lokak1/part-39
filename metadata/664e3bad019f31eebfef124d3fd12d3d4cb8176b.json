I had never posted them before as you are aware an extended play (EP) is a vinyl record or CD which contains more music than a single, but is too short to qualify as an LP. Usually, an EP has around 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“28 minutes of music, for this reason they never made it to 4 rare 80s albums series. Vol. 2 is my pick.\n\nDark White - The Grey Area \nLabel: Dark White Music  \nCatalog#: DW1001  \nFormat: Vinyl, Mini-Album\n \nCountry: US \nReleased: 1985 \nGenre: Electronic  \nStyle: Electro, Synth-pop, Gothic  \nCredits: Artwork By - Razah Renfield \nMastered By - Ron Lewter \nMixed By - Freeman* , Renfield* , Vosnos* \nPhotography - Brian Pfeiffer \nProducer - Razah Renfield , Theodora Vosnos \nWritten-By - Razah Renfield  \nNotes: Recorded At Remington Road Studios \n\n  \n\nTracklisting:\n\nA1   Call Of The Wild (Sub Domestic Mix) \nA2   Tendencies (Character Neurosis) \n     Bass - Bill Zinga Jr. \n     Drums - Tara Rich \n     Lyrics By - Sosa* , Renfield*  \nA3   Dramatics \nB1   Article Of Life \nB2   Call Of The Wild (Wild Mix) \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664e3bad019f31eebfef124d3fd12d3d4cb8176b","amp;dn":"Rare+80s+EPs+Vol.+2+-+Dark+White+-+The+Grey+Area+EP+%5B1985%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664e3bad019f31eebfef124d3fd12d3d4cb8176b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,78,59,173,1,159,49,238,191,239,18,77,63,209,45,61,76,184,23,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
