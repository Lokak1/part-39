The CD release is titled The Motown 50 Mixes. Less than an hour after the memorial service for Michael Jackson at the Staples Center, Universal Music Group announced The Stripped Mixes, a collection of Michael's classic songs. The Stripped Mixes was to feature &quot;stripped&quot; mixes of Michael Jackson's classic Motown-era songs. The &quot;stripped&quot; mix of the song &quot;I'll Be There&quot; by the The Jackson 5 was released onto iTunes as a prelude to The Stripped Mixes. The album was released to iTunes and other download stores on July 7, 2009. The CD version of the album, Michael Jackson: The Motown 50 Mixes, was released on July 28, 2009.\n\nAmazon.com - Utilizing the original Motown session tapes, the mixes on Michael Jackson: The Stripped Mixes strip away certain instruments and studio frills to instead focus on the essence of the spectacular recordings--Michael's vocals and the harmonies provided by his brothers. The new approach enhances those sparkling vocals, makes them the star rather than the pop production, and inevitably leads to an almost acoustic tone to the recordings. The result is a unique rediscovery of each of these classic songs. The recordings here are further proof that his music and performances will live forever.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I'll Be There          \tJackson 5\n[02] Ben                    \tMichael Jackson\n[03] Who's Lovin' You       \tJackson 5\n[04] Ain't No Sunshine      \tMichael Jackson\n[05] I Want You Back        \tJackson 5\n[06] ABC                    \tJackson 5\n[07] We've Got A Good Thing Going\tMichael Jackson\n[08] With A Child's Heart   \tMichael Jackson\n[09] Darling Dear           \tJackson 5\n[10] Got To Be There        \tMichael Jackson\n[11] Never Can Say Goodbye  \tJackson 5\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:38m:31s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 101mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\n\nRelease Date\t&gt; July 7, 2009 (online) July 28, 2009 (CD)\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; Universal International Music\n\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.michaeljackson.com \n          \t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson \n          \t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/j/jackson.html \n          \t&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/Michael+Jackson \n          \t&gt;\n           \t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/michaeljackson \n            \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6ab130bdbed4df74054ea3bd475784479dabf2","amp;dn":"%5B2009%5D+The+Motown+50+Mixes+-+Michael+Jackson+101mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6ab130bdbed4df74054ea3bd475784479dabf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,106,177,48,189,190,212,223,116,5,78,163,189,71,87,132,71,157,171,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
