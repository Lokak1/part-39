Recordings 1952-53\nLabel: Demon\nCD Released :2001\nFormat; Mp3@320\n\n\nRecorded in 1952 and 1953 for the JOB label, this is Johnny Shines at his most primal, and most of these songs find him working with a drumless trio. \n\nDelta bluesman Johnny Shines is most famous for having travelled and performed with Robert Johnson in the '30s, but his career extended several decades beyond Johnson's. He eventually wound up in Chicago, where he recorded for Job Records, but like many blues players of his generation Shines drifted out of music. In the late '60s he was among those whose careers were given a fresh start via &quot;rediscovery&quot; by the folk-revival generation. Shines began recording and performing again with a vengeance, his gritty voice and slide guitar still powerful. Failing health slowed him down in the early '80s, but even then he continued to play until his death in 1992.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 - Ramblin'\n2 - Fish Tail\n3 - Cool Driver\n4 - Ain't Doin' No Good\n5 - Livin' In The White House - Sunnyland Slim And His Boys\n6 - Please Don't (take 2) - Sunnyland Slim And His Boys\n7 - Evening Sun (take 3 - Master)\n8 - No Name Blues\n9 - Brutal Hearted Woman\n10 - Gonna Call The Angel (Master - take 1)\n11 - Evening Shuffle (take 1)\n12 - Gonna Call The Angel (Rehearsal)\n13 - Evening Shuffle (take 2)\n14 - Please Don't (take 1) - Sunnyland Slim And His Boys\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0591d88b77c6c4f2fa72394c36bc5f84d74dd967","amp;dn":"Johnny+Shines+Evening+Shuffle+The+Complete+J.O.B.+Recordings+195","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0591d88b77c6c4f2fa72394c36bc5f84d74dd967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,145,216,139,119,198,196,242,250,114,57,76,54,188,95,132,215,77,217,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
