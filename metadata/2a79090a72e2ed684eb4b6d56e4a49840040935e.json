In 1971, Chomsky helped government whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg release the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret internal U.S. account of the Vietnam War. Commenting on the revelations that several Arab leaders are urging the United States to attack Iran, Chomsky says, &quot;latest polls show] Arab opinion holds that the major threat in the region is Israel, thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢s 80 percent; the second threat is the United States, thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢s 77 percent. Iran is listed as a threat by 10 percent,&quot; Chomsky says. &quot;This may not be reported in the newspapers, but itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢s certainly familiar to the Israeli and U.S. governments and the ambassadors. What this reveals is the profound hatred for democracy on the part of our political leadership.&quot;\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License.\n\nBy Democracynow.org\n\n\nThis movie is part of the collection: Community Video\n\nAudio/Visual: sound, color\nKeywords: Wikileaks; Democracy; Noam Chomsky; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a79090a72e2ed684eb4b6d56e4a49840040935e","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky%3A+WikiLeaks+Cables+Reveal+%5C%22Profound+Hatred+for+Dem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a79090a72e2ed684eb4b6d56e4a49840040935e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,121,9,10,114,226,237,104,78,180,182,213,110,74,73,132,0,64,147,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
