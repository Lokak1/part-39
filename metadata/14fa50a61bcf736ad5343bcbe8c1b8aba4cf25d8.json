This intriguing question is the scientific province of behavioral biology, a field that explores interactions among the brain, mind, body, and environment that have a surprising influence on how we behave-from the people we fall in love with, to the intensity of our spiritual lives, to the degree of our aggressive impulses. In short, it is the study of how our brains make us the individuals that we are.\n\nBiology and Human Behavior: The Neurological Origins of Individuality, 2nd Edition, is an interdisciplinary approach to this fascinating subject. In 24 lectures, you will investigate how the human brain is sculpted by evolution, constrained or freed by genes, shaped by early experience, modulated by hormones, and otherwise influenced to produce a wide range of behaviors, some of them abnormal. You will see that little can be explained by thinking about any one of these factors alone because some combination of influences is almost always at work.\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1597&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1597&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLectures:\n\n01.

I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14fa50a61bcf736ad5343bcbe8c1b8aba4cf25d8","amp;dn":"TTC+VIDEO+-+Biology+and+Human+Behavior+%28compressed+1.6gb%29+public","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14fa50a61bcf736ad5343bcbe8c1b8aba4cf25d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,250,80,166,27,207,115,106,213,52,59,203,232,193,184,171,164,207,37,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
