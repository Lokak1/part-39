Some of Britain's best-known \n       and well-loved comedians, sportsmen and television personalities \n       step into their dancing shoes to raise money for Sport Relief, \n       after comedian Robert Webb's rendition of Flashdance won over \n       viewers who voted him champion of Let's Dance for Comic Relief in \n       2009.\n       \n       Each episode, three different celebrity guests offer words of wit \n       and wisdom as they review the acts. The guest panellists include \n       comedians Frank Skinner, Jason Manford, Jack Dee and Miranda Hart.\n       \n       Top choreographers help the celebrity dancers perfect their \n       routine before they take to the floor to give the performance of \n       their lives. They only have one shot to make their mark, and who \n       gets to the final is up to the viewers. The most popular act in a \n       telephone vote goes straight through the final; the panel decides \n       which of the two runners-up joins them. A portion of the revenue \n       from each vote goes to Sport Relief.\n       \n       As well as celebrity dancing, the first show features exclusive \n       performances from pop boyband JLS and girl group the Sugababes.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d791b8a5b4b297bfa2a4bff9b6be&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cbf39837478eea63f53d67a198a7e1337e46ed2","amp;dn":"Lets.Dance.For.Sport.Relief.2010.Part1.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cbf39837478eea63f53d67a198a7e1337e46ed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,191,57,131,116,120,238,166,63,83,214,122,25,138,126,19,55,228,110,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
