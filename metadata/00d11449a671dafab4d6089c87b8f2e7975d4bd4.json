But 20-25 years back, CDs were either rarely available or way too expensive for me. In those days cassette was king! I have a collection of over 300 cassettes of that era from mid-80s to mid-90s. A large number of them is unplayable today. So with a heavy heart, I have finally decided to dispose them off. But before doing so, I shall scan all the covers.\n\nIn this torrent, I am sharing with you covers of 50 cassettes. They are scanned at 600dpi and all are single-sided meaning there is nothing printed on the reverse side. Most of them are albums. In future, I shall share with you compilations, greatest hits &amp; double-sided covers depending on the response to this torrent. Full list is included in the torrent. So now you'll know what I was listening to as a teenager! Do write in your comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00d11449a671dafab4d6089c87b8f2e7975d4bd4","amp;dn":"My+50+Cassette+Covers+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00d11449a671dafab4d6089c87b8f2e7975d4bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,209,20,73,166,113,218,250,180,214,8,156,135,184,242,231,151,93,75,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
