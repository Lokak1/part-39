He was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented.&quot;\n\nBergson developed his philosophy in a number of books that have become famous not only for their fresh interpretation of life but also for a powerful employment of metaphor, image, and analogy.  In TIME AND FREE WILL (1889), his doctoral thesis, Bergson offered an interpretation of consciousness as existing on two levels, the first to be reached by deep introspection, the second an external projection of the first.  The deeper self is the seat of creative becoming and of free will.  The method of intuitive introspection, first employed in this work, is developed further in AN INTRODUCTION TO METAPHYSICS (1903).\n\nIn MATTER AND MEMORY (1896), Bergson again took up the study of consciousness, turning his attention to the relation of mind to body, arguing that this distinction is one of degree, not of kind.  The limiting concept of matter is interpreted as a momentary mind, completely deprived of a memory that helps make possible freedom of choice.  CREATIVE EVOLUTION (1907) provided an alternate explanation for Darwin's mechanism of evolution and developed the concept of time introduced in Bergson's other works and applied it to the study of living things, while THE TWO SOURCES OF MORALITY AND RELIGION (1932) extended these theories to the realms of morality, religion and art.\n\nMany of his essays, lectures and reviews are collected in MIND-ENERGY (1919) and his final book, THE CREATIVE MIND (1946), a masterly autobiography of his philosophical method.  KEY WRITINGS (2002) brings together generous selections from all the above major texts plus material from the MÃƒÂ©langes never before translated in English, such as the correspondence between Bergson and William James.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\n\n* CREATIVE EVOLUTION (Holt, 1911 / Modern Library, 1944).
