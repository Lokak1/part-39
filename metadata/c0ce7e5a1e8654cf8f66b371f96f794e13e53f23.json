And, for one tour only, Zappa was joined by Jean-Luc Ponty.\r\n\r\nThey twist and turn through some of Zappaâ€™s quirkier compositions, like RNDZL, Dog Breath and Echidnaâ€™s Arf (Of You). On the free-form showcase Further Oblivion, Ponty and Ian Underwood stretch out their solos, showing how talented this band was improvising. But the real standout here is Duke: he takes the vocal lead on Village of the Sun, delivers a wild keyboard solo and then leads the bandâ€™s improvisations on Dupreeâ€™s Paradise.\r\n\r\nBy turns jazzy and discordant, with Zappaâ€™s trademark â€œhumanly impossibleâ€ compositions, it is a wonderful document of one of the most celebrated of the line-ups of The Mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa &amp; The Mothers of Invention\r\n\r\nRoad Tapes, Venue # 2\r\n\r\n(Finlandia Hall, Helsinki, Finland, August 23 &amp; 24, 1973)\r\n\r\n2013\r\n\r\n\r\n2CDs / 2013 / VBR-V0\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\nDisc 1: \r\n\r\n1.
