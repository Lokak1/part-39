Known as â€œCoach Ladâ€, Ladouceur had little experience coaching football when he was hired at De La Salle, but through his unyielding focus on character-building, faith, responsibility and commitment, created one of the countryâ€™s greatest football dynasties.\r\n\r\nInducted into the National High School Hall of Fame and widely considered the greatest prep football coach of all time, Ladouceurâ€™s spectacular achievements during his 34 years with the De La Salle Spartans include a historic 12-year, 151-game run of consecutive wins, 20 undefeated seasons, seven national titles, five CIF Bowl championships, 17 state championships and 28 CIF North Coast titles. When Ladouceur retired in January 2013, he was the all-time winningest coach in California having amassed one of the highest-winning percentage of any coach (.934 percent) with his 399-25-3 record.\r\n\r\nâ€œOn the surface, it appears that these players just won a lot of football games, but what makes this story so special is that this is a coach who placed little value on winning, instead focusing his players on giving a â€˜perfect effortâ€™ in life,â€ said producer David Zelon. â€œUnderneath it is a resounding testimonial about how much more kids can achieve when they are challenged with responsibility and commitment.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90ef88ac60a79e65a8588a84c0fc9f9c90993273","amp;dn":"When+the+Game+Stands+Tall+-+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90ef88ac60a79e65a8588a84c0fc9f9c90993273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,239,136,172,96,167,158,101,168,88,138,132,192,252,159,156,144,153,50,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
