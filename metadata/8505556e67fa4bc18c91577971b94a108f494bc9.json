A pioneer of counterculture-era psychedelic rock, the group was the first band from the San Francisco scene to achieve international mainstream success. They performed at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960sÃ¢â‚¬â€Monterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as headlining the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968). Their 1967 record  Surrealistic Pillow is regarded as one of the key recordings of the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;. Two hits from that album, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, are listed in Rolling Stone's &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.\n\nThe membership of Jefferson Airplane remained stable from 1967 to early 1970. During that period, they enjoyed success as &quot;album&quot; artists. Between 1967 and 1972 they scored a run of eight consecutive Top 20 albums in the USA, with both Surrealistic Pillow and Crown of Creation making the Top 10. Despite a lack of top ten singles following their initial success, many of their singles still managed to make minor chart positions in the singles chart due in part to the growing influence of FM radio, which played many rock songs that AM radio did not. Successor bands to Jefferson Airplane include Jefferson Starship and Starship; spinoffs include Hot Tuna and KBC Band. Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVolunteers is a 1969 album (5th) by American psychedelic rock band, Jefferson Airplane, released as RCA Victor LSP-4238. It was also released in a Quadrophonic version in 1973 as RCA Quadradisc APD1-0320. It was controversial at the time because of anti-war messages of certain songs and occasional use of profanity in the lyrics.[citation needed] The original title of the album was intended to be Volunteers of Amerika, but after objections from Volunteers of America the name was shortened.\n\n\nBand:\n\nGrace Slick: vocals, piano on &quot;The Farm&quot;, &quot;Hey Fredrick&quot;, &quot;Eskimo Blue Day&quot;, and &quot;Volunteers&quot;, organ on &quot;Meadowlands&quot;, recorder on &quot;Eskimo Blue Day&quot;\n\nPaul Kantner: vocals, rhythm guitar\n\nMarty Balin: vocals, percussion\n\nJorma Kaukonen: lead guitar, vocals\n\nJack Casady: bass\n\nSpencer Dryden: drums, percussion\n\n\n\nAdditional Personnel\n\nNicky Hopkins: piano on &quot;We Can Be Together&quot;, &quot;Hey Fredrick&quot;, &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;, &quot;A Song for All Seasons&quot;, and &quot;Volunteers&quot;\n\nStephen Stills: hammond organ on &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot;\n\nJerry Garcia: pedal steel guitar on &quot;The Farm&quot;\n\nJoey Covington: congas on &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot;, chair on &quot;Eskimo Blue Day&quot;\n\nDavid Crosby: sailboat on &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;\n\nAce of Cups: vocals on &quot;The Farm&quot; and &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot;\n\nBill Laudner: lead vocals on &quot;A Song for All Seasons&quot;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBark is the sixth studio album by Jefferson Airplane. Released in 1971 as Grunt FTR-1001 (the first album on that label), is one of the late-period albums by Jefferson Airplane, notable for many &quot;firsts&quot; with its major personnel change; It was the first without band founder Marty Balin and the first with violinist Papa John Creach. Drummer Spencer Dryden had also departed, being replaced by Joey Covington. This was the first all new Airplane LP in two years, the previous being Volunteers, released in 1969. It was also the first to be released under the Jefferson Airplane owned Grunt Records label.\n\nLead guitarist Jorma Kaukonen has four songwriting credits on this album, indicative of his growing importance as a composer.
