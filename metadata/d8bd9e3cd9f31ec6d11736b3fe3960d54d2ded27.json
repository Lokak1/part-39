Tom Lorrison, the show's sponsor, is eager to make more films, but nobody has seen Smoky in ten years. Under intense pressure to produce the star, Frye hires Smoky's agent, Georgie Markham, to go look for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x540, 23.976 fps, 1800 Kbps, 01h21m36s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/smjamjsr1/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ubaxenkev/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/j2s5d4h7b/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/taaopj3fb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5kl90u51z/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8bd9e3cd9f31ec6d11736b3fe3960d54d2ded27","amp;dn":"Callaway+Went+Thataway+%281951+-+USA%29+%5BFred+MacMurray%5D+western","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8bd9e3cd9f31ec6d11736b3fe3960d54d2ded27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,189,158,60,217,243,30,198,209,23,54,179,254,57,96,213,77,45,237,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
