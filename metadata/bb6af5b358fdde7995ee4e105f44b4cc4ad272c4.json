We'll start off by learning how to set up a 2D Unity project. Then we'll learn how to properly import and slice our sprites. After that we'll learn how to manipulate sprites by blocking in a simple platform level and also learn the importance of Sorting Layers.\n\nThen we'll jump into the real fun by assembling, parenting and animating a character. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of working with Unity's 2D features.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb6af5b358fdde7995ee4e105f44b4cc4ad272c4","amp;dn":"Exploring+the+2D+Features+in+Unity+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb6af5b358fdde7995ee4e105f44b4cc4ad272c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,106,245,179,88,253,222,121,149,238,78,16,95,68,180,204,74,210,114,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
