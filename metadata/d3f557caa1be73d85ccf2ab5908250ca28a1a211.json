Mobilizing an astonishing range of media examples - from news anchors\\&amp;#039; idolatry of military machinery to the impact of government propaganda on war reporting - the film asks: How has war taken its place in the culture as an entertainment spectacle? And how does presenting war as entertainment affect the ability of citizens to evaluate the necessity and real human costs of military action? The film is broken down into nine sections, each between 10 and 20 minutes in length, allowing for in-depth classroom analysis of individual elements of this wide-ranging phenomenon. Written, produced &amp; narrated by Roger Stahl for the Media Education Foundation. Roger Stahl is Assistant Professor of Speech Communication at the University of Georgia. 124 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f557caa1be73d85ccf2ab5908250ca28a1a211","amp;dn":"Militainment%2C+Inc.+%28DVD+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f557caa1be73d85ccf2ab5908250ca28a1a211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,245,87,202,161,190,115,216,92,207,42,181,144,130,80,202,40,161,162,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
