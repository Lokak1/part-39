New EmuXtras are being worked on. \n\n\n\nRessurectionXtras is a project which goal is to preserve history of gaming. It was started by RessurectionX over at Scenyx forum a long time ago and gladly it seemed to be a project alot of people were interrested in. \n\nThe 80s/90s brought us into the home gaming \nera with consoles like Atari, Colecovision, Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System and many more. Over the years there have been quite a number of home consoles and tons of games released. These games are very hard to get a hold of today, but as we move further away from this era we also move further into the emulation-era which allows us to enjoy these games on new systems. \n\nThis project doesn't aim to just give access the games (roms as they are called), but more a collection containing the following: \n\n1. Artwork (Boxart, Screens, Gameplay video) \n2. Synopsis (Description, Developer \n++) \n3. Music (MIDI), Commercials \n4. Configs / Rumbles (XBOX) \n5. Game maps, Manuals \n\nPlatform and usage \n\nThis is not a frontend or emulator project. This is a project trying to conserve &quot;xtras&quot; related to the consoles/games. \n\nMembers of the project has put alot of work into making this easy-to-use for the XBOX1 console. We are hoping for some frontend/emulator authors to embrace this project and include support for it.
