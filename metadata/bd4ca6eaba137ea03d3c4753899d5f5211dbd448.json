Cut through the complexity of online documentation with this concise and illustrated book, and discover how easily you can get up to speed with these Python libraries. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll understand why theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re powerful enough for many of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading scientists and engineers.\n\nLearn how to use NumPy for numerical processing, including array indexing, math operations, and loading and saving data. With SciPy, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work with advanced mathematical functions such as optimization, interpolation, integration, clustering, statistics, and other tools that take scientific programming to a whole new level. This book also introduces add-on SciKits packages that focus on advanced imaging algorithms and machine learning.\n\n    Learn the capabilities of NumPy arrays, element-by-element operations, and core mathematical operations\n    Solve minimization problems quickly with SciPyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s optimization package\n    Use SciPy functions for interpolation, from simple univariate to complex multivariate cases\n    Apply a variety of SciPy statistical tools such as distributions and functions\n    Learn SciPyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spatial and cluster analysis classes\n    Save operation time and memory usage with sparse matrices\n    Delve into scikits-image for advanced imaging capabilities, and scikits-learn for machine learning and data mining \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd4ca6eaba137ea03d3c4753899d5f5211dbd448","amp;dn":"SciPy+and+NumPy%2C+E.+Bressert+%282012%29+%5B1449305466%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd4ca6eaba137ea03d3c4753899d5f5211dbd448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,76,166,234,186,19,126,160,61,60,71,83,137,157,95,82,17,219,212,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
