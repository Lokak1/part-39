I spent the better part of \n\nthe day on my porch with a fire and my dog, Jack, writing and reading ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Hidden Brain.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ To keep \n\nyou entertained tonight, I have rounded up my favorite links from this past week, some amazing, \n\nchilling and some heart-warming enough to take the chill out.\n\nUPDATE!\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been reading the blog over the last couple weeks, then you know weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been following \n\nthe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbear camÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that is perched just outside the entrance to the cave of Lily the Black Bear in \n\nEly, Minnesota. Recently, the bear cam has captured some early images of LilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new, \n\nas-of-yet-not-named cub on video and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all very exciting.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13745&amp;show=IM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13745&amp;show=IM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got to love the way the little baby bear is screaming there. Is the baby saying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfeed \n\nme!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œget off me youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re crushing me!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s freezing in here!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or a combination of both, \n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not sure. In fact, I know so little about bears that I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even pick up on what sex the \n\nbaby bear is although to those in the know, it was supposed to be obvious. That will make it \n\neasier to come up with a name for the bear in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œName the Baby BearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ contest thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being \n\nsponsored by Cub Foods, a big supermarket chain in the Upper Midwest.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13736&amp;show=IM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13736&amp;show=IM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJust because you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t live here, it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enter the contest! If you live in \n\nother parts of the U.S. or Canada, you could always win the gift certificates and have your \n\ngroceries shipped to you or donate them to a food bank.\n\nOf course, if you live in Canada, you might have other issues to worry about--like not becoming \n\nfood yourself to one of those giant wolves on the prowl. In this the biggest wolf ever shot?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13583&amp;show=IM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13583&amp;show=IM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWell, at least it will hold the record for another week until the new remake of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe WolfmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\ncomes out starring Benecio del Torro.\n\nMeanwhile down in New Orleans, Dr. Frankenstein has been found--that is, if you can trust his \n\npolitical opponents.\n\nThis is a real TV ad, although it looks like a hoax.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13699&amp;show=IM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13699&amp;show=IM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis website looks like a hoax too, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s real. A real what, I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell you, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s my \n\nnew favorite website, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSelleck Waterfall Sandwich,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which features, what else, images of Tom \n\nSelleck in a waterfall with a sandwich.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13682&amp;show=IM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13682&amp;show=IM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell if I love that site because of the total absurdity of it or because IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been \n\nfasting for the last two weeks and wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be having any sandwiches until the end of Lent!\n\nYikes. Maybe thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why I keep watching ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBizarre Foods with Andrew ZimmernÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ these days. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \n\nsomething about looking at Andrew eat a big bowl of cat lips in some Asian port city that just \n\nmakes fasting a little easier.\n\nAnyway, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one dog that nobody in Asia would dare eat!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13582&amp;show=IM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mytalk1071.com/show_elements/link.php?entryID=13582&amp;show=IM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKeep on smiling, everybody! If this dog can, we can too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a91f020f0daf404454296a1d92dac48fd58c400","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+02-06-10+Secrets+of+the+Mind+48kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a91f020f0daf404454296a1d92dac48fd58c400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,145,240,32,240,218,244,4,69,66,150,161,217,45,172,72,253,88,196,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
