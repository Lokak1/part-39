This book will teach you how to utilize the power of the Blender 2.7 series to create a wide variety of materials, textures, and effects with the Cycles rendering engine. You will learn about node-based shader creation, and master cycles through step-by-step, recipe-based advice. With this book, you will start small by rendering the textures of stones and water, then scale things up to massive landscapes of mountains and oceans. You will then learn how to create the look of different artificial materials such as plastic, carpenter wood, and metal, and utilize volumetric shaders to create the effects of smoke, clouds, and subsurface scattering effects of skin. You will also learn how illumination works in Cycles, improvising the quality of the final render, and how to avoid the presence of noise and fireflies. By the end, you will know how to create an impressive library of realistic-looking materials and textures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61bf6a3a590d160e4258f1d438adf52d8fe3bfce","amp;dn":"Blender+Cycles+Materials+and+Textures+Cookbook+-+3rd+Ed+-Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61bf6a3a590d160e4258f1d438adf52d8fe3bfce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,191,106,58,89,13,22,14,66,88,241,212,56,173,245,45,143,227,191,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
