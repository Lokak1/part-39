The disc includes both the software upgrade, and the new TeleAtlas data. The original image (7.28Gb) was obtained using Alcohol 120% (Media Descriptor File, MDF). It was compressed using WinRAR. You will need to decompress the MDF file to the original 7.28Gb image, then burn it to a double layer (DVD-DL) disc. This will only fit on a double layer disc. Insert disc to automatically start the upgrade.  It takes about 10 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:063b02cab11772c2e553a49a4ce1a30bde31e709","amp;dn":"Pioneer+Avic+Navigation+CNDV-70MTP+West+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"063b02cab11772c2e553a49a4ce1a30bde31e709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,59,2,202,177,23,114,194,229,83,164,154,76,225,163,11,222,49,231,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
