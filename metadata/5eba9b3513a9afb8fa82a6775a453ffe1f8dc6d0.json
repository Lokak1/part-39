The style of the videos are more like 70s and 80s shock exploitation, than of shitty MTV flash. The music is not death/black/hardcore/thrash, but a grating, discordant screech of feedback and snarls over a pummeling, sloppy rhythm; New Orleans sludgecore at some of it&amp;#039;s finest. \n\nSaying they are better or worse than Cannibal Corpse or Mortician (that one made me laugh out loud) is moot. Its like going to see one the above mentioned bands, and then taking a wrong turn and ending up at a Texas Chainsaw family barbecue; this music is fuckin&amp;#039; great and completely outside the box - FAR BETTER than either of the two bands mentioned above in my opinion. \n\nThis video is the best collection of their work to date. Jim Van Bebber is an amazing horror director, hopefully he will never break out - for his own good that is. Download this; break into your friend&amp;#039;s stash; buy some Jim Beam, and get sick on this film. 10/10\n\nThis torrent includes all the interview and rehearsal DVD extras.\n\n\nBURN TESTED!\n\nEnjoy and PLEASE SEED!\n\nAll files are XviD in 128 MP3 - the MediaInfo anaylisis below is for the main film only.\n\n\nGeneral:\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 600 MiB\nDuration                         : 28mn 34s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 933 Kbps\n\nVideo:\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 28mn 34s\nBit rate                         : 2 733 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.233\nStream size                      : 559 MiB (93%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio:\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 28mn 34s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 186 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 38.1 MiB (6%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 503 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings                : ABR\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eba9b3513a9afb8fa82a6775a453ffe1f8dc6d0","amp;dn":"Necrophagia.Through.Eyes.of.the.Dead.UNCUT.%28WITH.EXTRAS%29.%282002%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eba9b3513a9afb8fa82a6775a453ffe1f8dc6d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,186,155,53,19,169,175,184,250,130,166,119,90,69,63,254,31,141,198,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
