The Collected Stories from 1968 to 1985'\n\nFantagraphics Books, 1989\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Spain Rodriguez\n\nTrashman is a fictional character, a superhero created and drawn by Spain (a.k.a. Manuel Rodriguez) who appeared regularly in underground comix and magazines from 1968 through 1985. Trashman's first appearance was as a full page serial comic strip in the New York City underground newspaper the East Village Other. After moving from New York City to San Francisco in 1970, Spain teamed up with fellow underground comix artists R. Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Gilbert Shelton and others as contributors to Zap Comix, published by Last Gasp Publishing. Three full length Trashman: Agent of the Sixth International stories were published under the Subvert Comics title by &quot;Saving Grace, a Division of Keith Green Industrial Reality&quot;, a Rip Off Press spin-off, from 1970 to 1976.\n\nSince 1976, Trashman has appeared in such publications as High Times, Heavy Metal, Weirdo, San Francisco and the Fantagraphics anthology Zero Zero #2.\n\nTrashman is a hero of the working classes and champion of the radical left causes. The Trashman stories are set in a dystopian near-future America, which after having been ravaged by nuclear weapon attacks, has become a fascist police state, with &quot;vast urban conglomerations. Social ferment divided the land into a patchwork of virtually self-governing areas.&quot;\n\nThe Trashman series is one of the very few super hero stories depicted in the underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly as a recurring character. Trashman's post-apocalyptic setting and Marxist-anarchist overtones expressed Spain's own social and political beliefs, as well as the sensibilities of the anti-Vietnam War movement and the underground counterculture of the era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff070757edd898830253fbf5e8ea8342b806b451","amp;dn":"Spain+Rodriguez+-+Trashman+Lives+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff070757edd898830253fbf5e8ea8342b806b451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,7,7,87,237,216,152,131,2,83,251,245,232,234,131,66,184,6,180,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
