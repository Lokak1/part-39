In this lesson, we'll integrate it with this very site - in real-time!\n\nPlease note that we'll be using the official JavaScript library to send our events to Trak.io. If you'd instead prefer to tackle this directly with PHP, you could first register various custom events in your Laravel app, and then reference this package within your event handler(s) to perform your API requests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1229932f1d8572ae6ab1301f36e84391f3be9c0","amp;dn":"Laracasts+-+Feb.+24+-+Customer+Analysis+With+Trak.io","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1229932f1d8572ae6ab1301f36e84391f3be9c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,34,153,50,241,216,87,42,230,171,19,1,243,110,132,57,31,59,233,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
