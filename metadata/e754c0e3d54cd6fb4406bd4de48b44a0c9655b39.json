Adapted by Chuck Dixon and Brett Booth, the story is set many years after Dr. Frankenstein and his castle. As the publisher describes it: \n\nIn the 19th century, Dr. Victor Frankenstein brought his first creation to life, but a horrible turn of events forced him to abandon his creation and fall away from the public eye. Now, two centuries later, a serial killer is on the loose in New Orleans, and he's salvaging body parts from each of his victims, as if he's trying to create the perfect person. But the two detectives assigned to the case are about to discover that something far more sinister is going on...\n\n\nDean Koontz's Frankenstein is the collective title of a trilogy of novels co-written by Dean Koontz. Though technically of the mystery or thriller genres, the novels also feature the trappings of horror, fantasy, and science fiction. Three volumes so far have been or are about to be published: Prodigal Son, co-written with Kevin J. Anderson, was published in 2004; City of Night, co-written with Ed Gorman, was published in 2005; and Dead and Alive, written without a co-writer, scheduled to be released in 2009 according to Koontz.\n\nThe series is supposedly a modern updating of the mythology of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, although the similarities are mainly superficial. Set in present day New Orleans, the series follows the activities of Victor Frankenstein, now known as Helios, as he continues to create new life forms for his own purposes. Opposed to his activities are a pair of homicide detectives and Frankenstein's original monster, now known as Deucalion.\n\nWhile the original Monster was made with parts from dead humans, Victor Frankenstein is now using modern technology to create more creatures, particularly synthetic biology. The new race he is making is constructed and designed from the bottom-up, and can be seen as bio androids, artificial humans made of flesh. Their knowledge and behavior is even based on programs downloaded directly into their brain, which appears to be an advanced wetware computer.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources who wish to remain nameless.\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e754c0e3d54cd6fb4406bd4de48b44a0c9655b39","amp;dn":"Dean+Koontz%5C%27+Frankenstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e754c0e3d54cd6fb4406bd4de48b44a0c9655b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,84,192,227,213,76,214,251,68,6,189,77,228,139,68,160,201,101,91,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
