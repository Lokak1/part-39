Released in 2014, Images 13 is credited to the Dexter Romweber Duo, featuring Dexter on guitar and his sister Sara Romweber on drums (a format that recalls the Flat Duo Jets in their prime), and while this music is a bit less manic than the glory days of the FDJs, the approach and the thinking behind it are very much the same Ã¢â‚¬â€ primal roots music played with streetwise virtuosity but few frills, and a genuine love of that which evokes cool above all else. From the reverb-soaked film noir mood of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blackout!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the spooky atmospherics of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Weird (Aurora Borealis)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the relentless pound of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue SurfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the raunchy strut of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roll On,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ every tune on Images 13 conjures up a special flavor of its own, and Dexter knows how to bend his estimable skills to the needs of the song, while SaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drumming is solid and versatile, a worthy match for this music. Images 13 isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an all-out rock &amp; roll assault, but there are plenty of moments where Dex and Sara show they still can raise the roof Ã¢â‚¬â€ particularly a faithfully manic cover of the WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“So Sad About UsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ and pretty much everything here will sound welcome to anyone who has followed DexterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, or generally likes to hear a mad genius rip it up on the guitar. In short, Images 13 is another Dexter Romweber albumÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and over the past three decades, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just about always a great thing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fe412ccbfc30f97c7b37098042f56af44491dee","amp;dn":"Dex+Romweber+Duo+-+Images+13+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fe412ccbfc30f97c7b37098042f56af44491dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,228,18,204,191,195,15,151,199,179,112,152,4,47,86,175,68,73,29,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
