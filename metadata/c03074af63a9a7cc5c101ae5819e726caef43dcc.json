It is ranked as one of Springsteen's greatest songs, and often appears on lists of the top rock songs of all time.Rolling Stone magazine placed it as #86 on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot;\n\nThe lyrics to &quot;Thunder Road&quot; describe a young woman named Mary, her boyfriend, and their &quot;one last chance to make it real.&quot; Thematically, it reads as a nostalgic companion piece to &quot;Born to Run&quot;.\n\nMusically, the song opens with a quiet piano and harmonica introduction, meant, as Springsteen said years later in the Wings For Wheels documentary, as a welcoming to both the track and the album, a signifier that something was about to happen. Eschewing a traditional verse-and-chorus structure, the song's arrangement gradually ramps up in instrumentation, tempo and intensity. The title phrase is not used until the middle section of the song, and then is not used again. Finally, after the closing line there is a saxophone-and-piano duet in the instrumental coda.\n\nIn this song, Springsteen mentions Roy Orbison &quot;singing for the lonely&quot; on the radio. Orbison, one of whose best-known songs is &quot;Only the Lonely,&quot; was a huge influence on Springsteen.\n\nThe song's title comes from the Robert Mitchum film Thunder Road. Springsteen declared that he was somehow inspired from the movie despite not having seen it. As he says: &quot;I never saw the movie, I only saw the poster in the lobby of the theater.&quot;\n\nIn 2004, it was ranked #1 on the list of the &quot;885 All-Time Greatest Songs&quot; compiled by WXPN (the University of Pennsylvania's public radio station). Rolling Stone magazine placed it as #86 on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot; The song came in at #226 in Q magazine's list of the &quot;1001 Greatest Songs Ever&quot; in 2003, in which they described the song as &quot;best for pleading on the porch.&quot; Julia Roberts, when asked which song lyric described her most accurately, chose &quot;Thunder Road&quot;'s &quot;You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright.&quot; The song is featured in the book 31 Songs byauthor Nick Hornby. &quot;Thunder Road&quot; has also been ranked as the 166th best song of all time, as well as the #3 song of 1975, in an aggregation of critics' lists at acclaimedmusic.net.\n\n&quot;Thunder Road&quot; is one of Springsteen's most performed songs and an audience favorite. During the 1974 to 1977 Born to Run tours, &quot;Thunder Road&quot; was always played by Springsteen with nothing but a piano accompaniment, an example of which is found on Hammersmith Odeon London '75. Not until later in the tour did &quot;Thunder Road&quot; make full-band appearances. In the 1978 tour &quot;Thunder Road&quot; usually opened with Springsteen telling a story as to why he wrote the song, and it might segue out of some other more dirge-like song such as &quot;Racing in the Street&quot;.\n\nIn concert in the 1980s, the song was often played to close out the first set; the coda was stretched out to showcase E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons, then Clemons and Springsteen would charge at each other from opposite ends of the stage, with Springsteen sliding into Clemons in an embrace.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03074af63a9a7cc5c101ae5819e726caef43dcc","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Thunder+Road+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03074af63a9a7cc5c101ae5819e726caef43dcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,48,116,175,99,169,167,204,92,16,26,229,129,158,114,108,174,244,61,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
