Eric and his gang have planned to raid the only bank in the city which is open on Bastille day. Zed is trapped in a situation beyond his control when heroin abuse, poor planning and a call-girl named Zoe all conspire to turn the robbery into a very bloody seige.\n\n\n\nCONTAINER....................: MP4\nCODEC........................: X264\nGENRE........................: Drama\nFILE SIZE....................: 3.95 GB (plus extras)\nRESOLUTION/ASPECT RATIO......: 1080p @ 1.85:1 (1918x1030) (extras are mostly 576p)\nBITRATE MODE.................: Variable\nAVG.

The [HQ] line will be exclusively encoded from physical blu-ray and not a master digital source file like most other encoders use. Bit rates and therefore file sizes will be substantially larger which is necessary to maintain picture quality on screens up to 60&quot; but will still be not outrageously large to download. Audio bit rates on these will be 256kbps, an upgrade from the 160kbps of my non-HQ encodes (compare to YIFY's 96kbps or lower.) Video bitrates will be in the 4000-7000kbps range depending on content as opposed to 2250-2800kbps which I used for the non-HQ encodes. Good enough for screen sizes up to 32&quot; or so, but not good enough for 50 or 60&quot; screens. \n\nAll of the extras were encoded using a CRF of 18 with TESA motion estimation method and most of the extras are in 576p since the source is PAL (the director's cut blu-ray of Killing Zoe was only released in France.) \n\n\nThis is the Director's Cut of Killing Zoe. It is 3 minutes longer than the theatrical release. This is the only torrent so far of this film in 1080p at all (all others are 720p and most do not contain English subtitles for the French portions of the film) and is the only torrent to contain the extras from the Director's Cut blu-ray, which was only released in France. Please seed as long as possible, at least until reaching a share ratio of 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72cfc95a4ba0128cdb5b60a5d347deda4394025","amp;dn":"Killing+Zoe+%281993%29+%5B1080p%5D+x264+BRRip+%5BHQ%5D+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72cfc95a4ba0128cdb5b60a5d347deda4394025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,44,252,149,164,186,1,40,205,181,182,10,93,52,125,237,164,57,64,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
