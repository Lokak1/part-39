In the glut of hard rock and heavy metal bands of the late '70s, their first albums got somewhat lost in the shuffle, although they were fairly popular in Europe and Japan. During 1982, Coverdale took some time off so he could take care of his sick daughter. When he re-emerged with a new version of Whitesnake in 1984, the band sounded revitalized and energetic. Slide It In may have relied on Led Zeppelin's and Deep Purple's old tricks, but the band had a knack for writing hooks; the record became their first platinum album. Three years later, Whitesnake released an eponymous album (titled 1987 in Europe) that was even better. Portions of the album were blatantly derivative -- &quot;Still of the Night&quot; was a dead ringer for early Zeppelin -- but the group could write powerful, heavy rockers like &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; that were driven as much by melody as riffs, as well as hit power ballads like &quot;Is This Love.&quot; Whitesnake was an enormous international success, selling over six million copies in the U.S. alone. \n\n\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Frontiers\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Burn\n02.You Fool No One\n03.Love Child\n04.Sail Away\n05.The Gypsy\n06.Lady Double Dealer\n07.Mistreated\n08.Holy Man\n09.Might Just Take Your Life\n10.You Keep On Moving\n11.Soldier Of Fortune\n12.Lay Down Stay Down\n13.Stormbringer\n14.Lady Luck (Bonus Track)\n15.Comin' Home (Bonus Track)\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e098e709456ac04092b87e4ae5b4b8cdf890962","amp;dn":"Whitesnake+-+The+Purple+Album+%28Deluxe%29+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e098e709456ac04092b87e4ae5b4b8cdf890962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,9,142,112,148,86,172,4,9,43,135,228,174,91,75,140,223,137,9,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
