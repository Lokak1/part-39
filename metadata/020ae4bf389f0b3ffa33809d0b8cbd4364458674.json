Corpses littered the streets, and dust clouds resembled the fog of war like the pyroclastic flow emanating from the world trade center buildings 1, 2, and 7.\n\nOn January 12, 2010, Port-au-Prince, Haiti was leveled by one of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history. Those responsible for handling the catastrophe, including the Haitian state and the United Nations, were crippled by the magnitude of the disaster, and stuggled to respond.\n\nIn the confused aftermath, survivors were left without food, water, or shelter. FRONTLiNE correspondent Martin Smith arrived in Port-au-Prince within days, and in this powerful report, bears witness to the disaster, and the ill-coordinated relief efforts in the Western hemisphere. The US army took control of the airport. Television reporters showed up before doctors, shoes and clothes before bandages. \n\nHundreds of people received amputations in makeshift field hospitals, without anesthetic or painkillers, and often done with a simple hacksaw. It resembled a war-zone, the quake decimated an already weak and inefficient government, wiping out 11 ministries and the parliament, even the national palace, an enduring symbol to all Haitians, had collapsed. \n\n&quot;It was like if a city like Washinton DC woke up, and the white house is flattened, the congress is flattened, fbi, cia, the banks, all the banks, all their communications systems, flattened.&quot; ~ Raymond Joseph, Haitian ambassador to the US\n\nHaiti's story is one of a dream denied. It's a story from 200 years ago, when Haiti was ruled by French colonists. The wealth of colonial Haiti was legendary, it produced half the world's sugar cane, two-thirds of it's coffee, and contributed more than half the foreign-exchange of colonial France. There was talk in the 18th century of possibly trading it for Canada. It was called the &quot;Pearl of the Antilles&quot;.\n\nThe Glorious Haitian revolution was the only successful slave revolt in history, when in 1804, half a million slaves were able to defeat the superpower of the day, Napoleonic France, and declare independence as the only black republic on the face of the globe. Toussaint L'ouverture (1743-1803), was the leader of the Haitian Revolution. His military genius and political acumen transformed an entire society of slaves into the independent black state of Haiti. The success of the Haitian Revolution shook the institution of slavery throughout the New World, and resulted in the Louisiana purchase of 1803, which doubled the size of the United States for $15 million US dollars ($230 million in 2012 fiat)\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1i5djoh0/cf459cd1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1i5djoh0/cf459cd1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1imkqhmg/6ea81641&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1imkqhmg/6ea81641&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/5cr9nyxy/46e38dc5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/5cr9nyxy/46e38dc5&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPBS Frontline - Battle For Haiti [2011] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8557691/PBS_Frontline_-_Battle_For_Haiti_%5B2011%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8557691/PBS_Frontline_-_Battle_For_Haiti_%5B2011%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTHE ATOMiC CafÃƒÂ© (DVD5, 1982)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8450438/THE_ATOMiC_Caf_eacute__%28DVD5__1982%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8450438/THE_ATOMiC_Caf_eacute__%28DVD5__1982%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSouth Of The Border (DVD9, 2009)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8552024/South_Of_The_Border_%28DVD9__2009%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8552024/South_Of_The_Border_%28DVD9__2009%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Great Conspiracy 9/11 News Special You Never Saw (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8585230/The_Great_Conspiracy_9_11_News_Special_You_Never_Saw_%28DVD5%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8585230/The_Great_Conspiracy_9_11_News_Special_You_Never_Saw_%28DVD5%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTHiNG iS SAFE (DVD5 x3) iSRAEL'S 2006 WAR ON LEBANON &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8453796/NOTHiNG_iS_SAFE_%28DVD5_x3%29_iSRAEL_S_2006_WAR_ON_LEBANON&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8453796/NOTHiNG_iS_SAFE_%28DVD5_x3%29_iSRAEL_S_2006_WAR_ON_LEBANON&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNelson Mandela's 70th Birthday Tribute Concert (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8513630/Nelson_Mandela_s_70th_Birthday_Tribute_Concert_%28DVD5%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8513630/Nelson_Mandela_s_70th_Birthday_Tribute_Concert_%28DVD5%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n9/11 THE FALLiNG MAN (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8420754/9_11_THE_FALLiNG_MAN_%28DVD5%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8420754/9_11_THE_FALLiNG_MAN_%28DVD5%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCHiUNE SUGiHARA is the real Schindler, and a Japanese diplomat at that (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8415536/SUGiHARA_a___Conspiracy_of_Kindness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8415536/SUGiHARA_a___Conspiracy_of_Kindness&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeeders are like pirate angels!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:020ae4bf389f0b3ffa33809d0b8cbd4364458674","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline+%7E+The+Quake%3A+Haiti+%28DVD5%2C+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"020ae4bf389f0b3ffa33809d0b8cbd4364458674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,10,228,191,56,159,11,63,250,51,128,157,11,140,189,67,100,69,134,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
