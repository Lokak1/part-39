He is on the editorial board of several journals. Dr. NayakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s research interests are in the areas of fault tolerance, distributed systems/algorithms, and mobile ad-hoc networks. Ivan StojmenoviC?, PhD, is Professor at the University of Ottawa, Canada (www.site.uottawa.ca/~ivan), and Chair Professor of Applied Computing at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. Dr. Stojmenovic? received the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. His current research interests are mostly in the design and analysis of algorithms for wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks.\n\nISBN: 0470044926 \n560 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0853395c76f4d1eedae9d6cd6f6b626c38f7dd32","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Applied+Algorithms+-+Solving+Scientific%2C+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0853395c76f4d1eedae9d6cd6f6b626c38f7dd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,83,57,92,118,244,209,238,218,233,214,205,111,107,98,108,56,247,221,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
