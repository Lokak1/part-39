He is accompanied in many tales by his hard-drinking deputy, Jimmy McClure, and later also by Red Woolley, a rugged pioneer.\n\nDonovan is the son of a rich Southern farmer and started as a dedicated racist. He was framed for a murder he did not commit, had to flee and was saved by an African-American. He became an enemy of discrimination of all kinds, fought against the Confederates (although he was a Southerner himself), and tried to protect the rights of Native Americans.\n\nLieutenant Blueberry: Fort Navajo Series:\n\nFort Navajo \nThunder in the West \nLone Eagle\n Mission to Mexico \nThe Lost Rider \nThe Man with the Silver Star \n\nLieutenant Blueberry:\n\nThe Iron Horse\nSteel Fingers\n General Golden Mane \nThe Trail of the Sioux\n\nMarshall Blueberry:\n\nThe Lost Dutchman's Mine \nThe Ghost with the Golden Bullets\n\nThe Young Blueberry :\n\nBlueberry's Secret \nA Yankee Named Blueberry \nThe Blue Coats \n\nBlueberry:\n\nChihuahua Pearl \nThe Half-a-Million Dollar Man\nBallad for a Coffin \nThe Outlaw\nAngel Face \nBroken Nose\nThe Ghost Tribe \nThe Long March\nThe End of the Trail \nThe Last Card\nArizona Love \n\nCredits goes to the original scanner..i have just compiled everything..I love Blueberry series..hope everybody does the same..enjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b9fc7677a8a97c493e63a3f8fc50bfcb8fe07f","amp;dn":"Blueberry+English+Scanlations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b9fc7677a8a97c493e63a3f8fc50bfcb8fe07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,185,252,118,119,168,169,124,73,62,99,163,248,252,80,191,203,143,224,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
