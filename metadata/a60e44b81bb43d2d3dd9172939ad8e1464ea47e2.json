The player can run left, right and jump, but can also turn the world clockwise and counterclockwise by 90 degrees. When this happens physics works the following way: as soon as rotation starts all objects get frozen and after rotation objects continue to move with their velocities (direction and speed) they had before. With this ability you can move objects and yourself but also need to keep orientation and watch out for dangerous situations. Don't worry though, you' re made out of paper so you can die as often as you want to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a60e44b81bb43d2d3dd9172939ad8e1464ea47e2","amp;dn":"And+Yet+It+Moves+-compact70","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a60e44b81bb43d2d3dd9172939ad8e1464ea47e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,14,68,184,27,180,61,45,61,217,23,41,57,173,142,20,100,234,71,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
