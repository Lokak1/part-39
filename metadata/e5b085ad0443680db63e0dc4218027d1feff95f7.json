The result is a brighter, more outgoing record than its predecessor Vision, veering between Western acoustic and electric grooves and the complex beats churned out by the tabla. Jan Garbarek again shines beams of light on soprano and tenor, engaging Shankar's ten-string double-necked electric violin in some complex interplay on the title track. Some tracks are driven entirely or partially by the drum machine; &quot;Paper Nut&quot; has a particularly infectious revolving pattern. But sometimes Shankar overdoes it; the lengthy &quot;Watching You&quot; has an overly mechanized feeling that can be either mesmerizing or infuriating, depending upon your mood. On another track, &quot;I Know,&quot; the Western percussion is gradually swallowed up by the Indian tabla. Fascinating, free-thinking music, beautifully recorded as usual by ECM.\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Shankar - 10-string double violin, drum machine\n    Jan Garbarek - soprano and tenor saxophone\n    Zakir Hussain - tabla, congas\n    Trilok Gurtu - percussion\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Paper Nut&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:08\n    &quot;I Know&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:38\n    &quot;Watching You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 13:17\n    &quot;Conversation&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:55\n    &quot;Song for Everyone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:28\n    &quot;Let's Go Home&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:32\n    &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b085ad0443680db63e0dc4218027d1feff95f7","amp;dn":"Shankar+-+Song+For+Everyone+%281985%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b085ad0443680db63e0dc4218027d1feff95f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,176,133,173,4,67,104,13,182,62,13,196,33,128,39,209,254,255,149,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
