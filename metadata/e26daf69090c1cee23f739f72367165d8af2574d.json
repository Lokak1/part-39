The\n      cheeky comedy panel series sets out to predict and analyse what\n      the almighty British public thinks about the week's most talked\n      about subjects. Presenter and stand up comic Jimmy Carr takes\n      the centre chair and is joined by witty team captains Sean Lock\n      and Jason Manford. Alongside them are panellists from the world\n      of comedy, entertainment and showbiz. This edition's guests\n      include Claudia Winkleman and Jamelia. Each team thrashes out\n      the topics of the week by examining surveys, opinion polls and\n      statistics; discussing all that is silly and serious. Potential\n      subjects could include showbiz gossip, world politics and even\n      the weather. Can the team captains reach the same conclusions as\n      the public... and most importantly, who will give the funniest\n      answers?\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n                                                      \n       We're currently looking for :-                                \n                                                                     \n      A 10mbit+ box on a private line to use as a grp dump,         \n       exclusively for grp use.                                      \n                                                                     \n      Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED and NO .US!                       \n                                                                     \n      UK PDTV/HDTV cappers.                                         \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      If you're a P2P retard don't even bother emailing us, because \n       we WILL hurl abuse at you.
