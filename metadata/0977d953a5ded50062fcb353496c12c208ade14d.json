The film opens with Encolpio (Martin Potter) vying with his friend Ascilto (Hiram Keller) for the affections of a young effeminate lad named Gitone (Max Born). When the youth chooses his rival or him, Encolpio begins a journey that has him encountering Romans of every stripe and color. He drops in on an orgy thrown by Trimalchio (Mario Romagnoli), a wealth-loving ex-slave who has spurned his wife in favor of a pleasures of a young boy; he toils on a slave galley, fighting off the advances of Lichas (Alain Cuny) -- the ship's burly wall-eyed captain; he steals an albino hermaphrodite demi-god who is reputed to be able to tell the future; and fails to summon the enthusiasm to make love to a whore-priestess. Along the way, we witness a parade of prostitutes in ancient Rome's pleasure quarters; watch performance by Vernacchio (Fanfulla), an actor whose on-stage specialties include farting and public amputation; and the wonton devouring of a human corpse for financial gain.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Satyricon.1969.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 335 Kbps\nLength            : 6.65 GiB for 2h 9mn 42s 949ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 538 (2.379) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : it\n\nAudio #1          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064940/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064940/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Italian, Latim\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip of Criterion Blu-Ray","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0977d953a5ded50062fcb353496c12c208ade14d","amp;dn":"Satyricon.1969.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0977d953a5ded50062fcb353496c12c208ade14d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,119,217,83,165,222,213,0,98,252,179,83,73,108,18,194,8,173,225,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
