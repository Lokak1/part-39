Bi-racial bartender Chuji (Tanabe Seichi), son of an Okinawan mother and a black American GI, moves into a music career after a record executive hears his dynamic blues harmonica playing. When young yakuza Kenji (Ikeuchi Hiroyuki) collapses in the alley behind the nightclub where Chuji works, his life is saved by Chuji&amp;#039;s girlfriend, a veteran&amp;#039;s assistant. It&amp;#039;s the beginning of a dangerous association, as the gangster introduces the bluesman to another way of life -- and soon trouble erupts. Shown at the 1998 Vancouver Film Festival.\nBhob Stewart\n\nA voice from IMDB\n\nAnother masterpiece from Takashi Miike, 26 April 2002\n10/10\n\nTakashi MiikeÃ‚Â´s 1998 film BLUES HARP is not as outrageous as FUDOH or DEAD OR ALIVE and not as disturbing and shocking as AUDITION or VISITOR Q. It isnÃ‚Â´t a gory bloodbath like ICHI THE KILLER. It is a Yakuza film very much along the lines of CHINESE MAFIA SEASON, RAINY DOG and LEY LINES.\n\nBLUES HARP is a really great film. I was once again amazed how many of my favorite films are from Miike-san. BLUES HARP has now joined them. The actors are great, the cinematography is gorgeous (once again by HANA BI cinematographer and longtime Miike collaborator Hideo Yamamoto) and most importantly what happens on-screen feels REAL. You get the feeling that real people lead these kinds of life all the time and (in variations) all over the world. And even though we are dealing with criminals here Miike portrays them with what seems like genuine affection, even love while never, NEVER, glorifying the Yakuza lifestyle. One gets the feeling he really knows what he is making films about and considering his past that is most probably true. Whatever Miike does in the future IÃ‚Â´ll be there and every film lover should keep an eye on this man.\n\nFile Name .............: Takashi Miike -  Blues Harp (1998).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 734,355,456 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 1:47:02 (4189808 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD Dev ver. 25-Mar-03\nFrame Size ............: 640x272 [=2.353]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 781 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.187 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: []...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 125 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 42 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1 \n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
