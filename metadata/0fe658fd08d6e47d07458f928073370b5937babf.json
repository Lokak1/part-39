Teamed up with trombonist Richard Boone (listed on the LP on trumpet), trumpeter Martin Banks, and pianist Dolo Coker, Gordon is in excellent form on the six selections, all originals by either the leader or Coker. Because of the large amount of Dexter Gordon recordings from his later years, this collection is not essential but fans should enjoy it.\n\nDexter Gordon - tenor saxophone\nRichard Boone - trombone\nMartin Banks - trumpet\nDolo Coker - piano\nCharles Green - bass\nLawrence Marable - drums\n\nProduced by Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley\n\nRecorded at United Recording Studios, Los Angeles, CA; October 13, 1960.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe658fd08d6e47d07458f928073370b5937babf","amp;dn":"%5BJAZZ%5D+Dexter+Gordon+-+The+Resurgence+of+Dexter+Gordon+%281960%29+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe658fd08d6e47d07458f928073370b5937babf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,230,88,253,8,214,228,125,7,69,143,146,128,115,55,11,89,55,186,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
