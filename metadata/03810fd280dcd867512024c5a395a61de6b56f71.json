He discovers our sense of time passing and the clocks that drive our bodies. He reveals the forces of \ntime that make and destroy us in a lifetime. He journeys to some of the Earth's most spectacular geological sites to look for clues to the extraordinary depths of time at a planetary level. Finally, he takes us on a cosmic journey in search of the beginning (and the end) of time itself. \n\n\n1. DAYTIME\nTime seems to drive every moment. It's the most inescapable force we feel. But do we experience time from within our minds and bodies or from the outside? \n\n2. LIFETIME\nThe most powerful effect of time on our lives is the way it limits us. Our knowledge of death is so embedded in our lives and spirituality that, were immortality possible, would we lose the sense that makes us human? \n\n3. EARTH TIME\nWe hold a unique knowledge of time, realising that it stretches deep into the past, and will continue into the future. How does this affect our sense of who we are? \n\n4. COSMIC TIME\nWe've always structured our lives based on an unchanging past and a predictable and ordered future. But atomic and cosmic discoveries have changed all that. What is time itself? And will it ever end?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/time.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/time.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nMore stuff here:                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MartinBLCK/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MartinBLCK/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03810fd280dcd867512024c5a395a61de6b56f71","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03810fd280dcd867512024c5a395a61de6b56f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,129,15,210,128,220,216,103,81,32,36,197,163,149,166,29,230,181,111,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
