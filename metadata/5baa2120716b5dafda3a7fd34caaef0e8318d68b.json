Working with the rest of the Blue Wing members, your goal is to clear a series of missions that pit you against armed crime groups. Missions begin with a briefing, where lovely Blue Wing operator Ryo Kawase gets you up to date on the crime scene. During this area of the game, you can speak to other Blue Wing members to get more information. Prior to starting the mission, you assemble and arm a team of Blue Wings best suited for the job, also selecting the most appropriate vehicle and the formation of your team. Once the planning phase is finished, the team scrambles, with you being responsible for directing their attacks. The game includes over fifty missions.\n\n\nDo you missing a game? Write a comment with the game you want and I will try to upload that game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5baa2120716b5dafda3a7fd34caaef0e8318d68b","amp;dn":"World+Super+Police+%5BPS2%5D+%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5baa2120716b5dafda3a7fd34caaef0e8318d68b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,170,33,32,113,107,93,175,218,58,127,211,76,170,239,14,131,24,214,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
