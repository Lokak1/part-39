Published in 1968, the bulk of the creative work of the series was handled by Anthro creator Howie Post. Post handled the writing, pencilling and inking of the series, while Joe Orlando served as the editor. Designed as an ongoing series, Anthro was canceled at issue #6, after an cost increase drove many of DC Comics' books from a 12 cents cover to a 15 cents cover. This resulted in a cliffhanger ending for issue 6 revolving around Anthro's fate with his love Embra. Anthro and his family would not be seen again until the Crisis of Infinite Earths, with the exception of a cameo for the celebratory Showcase #100.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a38c8d1333d0dbbda081735b075c8ed9bf3637","amp;dn":"Anthro+%2801+-+06+%2B+Showcase+74%29+%281968+-+1969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a38c8d1333d0dbbda081735b075c8ed9bf3637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,163,140,141,19,51,208,219,189,160,129,115,91,7,92,142,217,191,54,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
