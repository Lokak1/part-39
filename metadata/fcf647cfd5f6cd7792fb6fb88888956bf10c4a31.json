The melon-breasted ANGEL, a living invitation - an exaggerated embodiment of woman... The cushion of evil on the throne of immorality... LANA is seventeen, with a slim beautifully curved body carried gracefully on long, intriguing legs. Truly delicious... LOTTIE... A string of &quot;ladyfingers&quot; that never stop exploding and detonating, with a percussion and snap beyond their size... HAJI...elusive, hauntingly seductive, a sorceress...a naked witch, if you will... SYLVIA...the go-go dancer... with a bosom of truly incredible dimension. And Carol Peters as THE NUDE... cantilevered, capacious with a capital double-D...floating gracefully across the silver screen.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDirected by: Russ Meyer\n\nWriting credits: Jack Moran\n\nGenre: Crime / Drama\n\nKeywords From IMDB: Independent Film, Buxom, Erotica\n\nTaglines: \n- The ULTIMATE Film...by Russ Meyer\n- ...for those who measure success only in the hours before the morning light!\n\nPlot Outline: Tales of eleven losers are told and interwoven. Burt can&amp;#039;t satisfy Angel, so she seeks the arms of another man, who is caught by Angel in the arms of another woman. Angel ends up with Justin, who ends up with a co-worker&amp;#039;s wife. As Angel and Burt argue, a sorceress watches, and eventually seduces Burt while Angel gets to know Ray, who had previously chased a blonde girl down on the coast. You get the idea.\nSummary written by Ed Sutton {...@mindspring.com}\n\nUser Comments: Good Russ Meyer (more)\n\nUser Rating: ****______ 4.2/10 (86 votes)\n\nCredited cast:\nToby Adler\t.... \tBetty\nAlaina Capri\t.... \tAngel Boland\nKaren Ciral\t.... \tLana Boland\nHaji\t\t.... \tThe Catalyst\nTom Howland\t.... \tHerb\nDon Johnson\t.... \tRay\nStuart Lancaster\t.... \tBurt Boland\nJoe Perrin\t.... \tNarrator\nCarol Peters\t.... \tNude\nSylvia Tedemar\t.... \tGo-go Dancer\nMegan Timothy\t.... \tLottie\nPatrick M.
