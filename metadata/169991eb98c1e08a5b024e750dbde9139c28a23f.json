In fact,\nthere isn't much concentration on hits from the previous year, either --\nthough Usher's &quot;Love in This Club,&quot; Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown's &quot;No\nAir,&quot; Jennifer Hudson's &quot;Spotlight,&quot; and John Legend's &quot;Green Light&quot; are\nincluded. Instead, R&amp;B Love Songs 2009 skips across three decades, reaching\nas far back as 1981 for Luther Vandross' &quot;Never Too Much,&quot; and it doesn't\neven limit itself to love songs or straight R&amp;B (Missy Elliott's &quot;The\nRain,&quot; Anthony Hamilton's &quot;Comin from Where I'm From,&quot; Sean Paul's &quot;Like\nGlue&quot;). Even with the confusion, there's no denying that this is a\nwell-selected, wide-ranging set that should appeal to just about any fan of\nmodern R&amp;B. You can't go wrong with a compilation that includes Anita\nBaker's &quot;Sweet Love,&quot; Keith Sweat's &quot;I Want Her,&quot; Angie Stone's &quot;Wish I\nDidn't Miss You,&quot; and Omarion's &quot;Ice Box.&quot;\n\n: URL:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:169991eb98c1e08a5b024e750dbde9139c28a23f","amp;dn":"VA-R+and+B+Lovesongs-2CD-FLAC-2009-DeVOiD-JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"169991eb98c1e08a5b024e750dbde9139c28a23f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,153,145,235,152,193,224,138,91,2,78,117,13,189,233,19,156,40,162,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
