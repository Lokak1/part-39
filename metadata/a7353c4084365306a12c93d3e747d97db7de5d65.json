Bandits are nearby, torturing and killing the survivors. El Topo rescues a woman (Mara), who leads him on a mission to find and defeat the four master gunmen of the desert. Leaving his son with a group of monks, El Topo and Mara complete the mission, accompanied by a mysterious woman in black. The women leave El Topo wounded in the desert, where he is found by a clan of deformed people who take him to the remote cavern where they live. Awakening years later, he goes with a dwarf woman to a nearby town, promising to dig a tunnel through which the cave-dwellers can escape. They find the town run by a vicious sheriff and home to a bizarre religious cult. El Topo&amp;#039;s son, now a man, is a monk in the town. The completion of the tunnel leads El Topo, the townspeople, and the cave-dwellers to a bloody and tragic end.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067866/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067866/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7353c4084365306a12c93d3e747d97db7de5d65","amp;dn":"El+Topo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7353c4084365306a12c93d3e747d97db7de5d65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,53,60,64,132,54,83,6,161,44,147,211,231,71,217,125,183,222,93,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
