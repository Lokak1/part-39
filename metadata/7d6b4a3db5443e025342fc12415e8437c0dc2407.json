Parmy Olson goes behind the headlines and into the world of Anonymous and LulzSec with unprecedented access, drawing upon hundreds of conversations with the hackers themselves, including exclusive interviews with all six core members of LulzSec.\nIn late 2010, thousands of hacktivists joined a mass digital assault on the websites of VISA, MasterCard, and PayPal to protest their treatment of WikiLeaks. Other targets were wide ranging-the websites of corporations from Sony Entertainment and Fox to the Vatican and the Church of Scientology were hacked, defaced, and embarrassed-and the message was that no one was safe.\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Computer related","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6b4a3db5443e025342fc12415e8437c0dc2407","amp;dn":"We+Are+Anonymous_+Inside+the+Ha+-+Parmy+Olson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6b4a3db5443e025342fc12415e8437c0dc2407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,107,74,61,181,68,62,2,83,66,252,18,65,94,132,55,192,220,36,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
