The Vatican has recently discovered that all demons originated from a dark and distant planet known as Sullen Dun.  Father Olin Caedius, a 400 year old magic priest, has established a fortress known as the Hinterland on this malevolent world.  The Hinterland monitors demonic activity and alerts the Vatican when demons approach Earth.  A mysterious man called Ramus was captured and charged with creating these demons.  Sisters Ruth and Margaret, falsely accused of murder, were sentenced to Earth in disgrace.\n\nWarrior Nun Dei was the last of her kind left in the Hinterland.  Father Caedius proclaimed that Dei's holy powers were the results of his human ingenuity.  Dei challenged his blasphemous assertions and she was promptly excommunicated, stripped of her powers.\n\nDemons attacked the base, and during the battle with the magic priests, Dei was lost and left for dead in a tangle of poisonous vines.  While praying in despair, her waning faith was reaffirmed.  Futz, one of Ramus' former spies, rescues Dei and nurses her back to health.  He then sets off to return her to the Hinterland.\n\nThanks goes to Talon for this release.\n\nWarrior Nun Dei: Aftertime #1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9123503&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9123503&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWarrior Nun Dei: Aftertime #2: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9254508&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9254508&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
