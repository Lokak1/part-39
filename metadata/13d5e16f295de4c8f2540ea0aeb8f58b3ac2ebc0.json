We just wanted to let you know that Dec. 31 was the last day that The Hero of Time was available for viewing. We came to an agreement with Nintendo earlier this month to stop distributing the film.  In the spirit of the holiday season they were good enough to let us keep the movie up for you to watch and enjoy through the end of 2009, but not past 2009.  We understand NintendoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right to protect its characters and trademarks and understand how in order to keep their property unspoiled by fanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interpretation of the franchise, Nintendo needs to protect itself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even from fan-works with good intentions.&quot;\n\nso dont let it die keep seeding this atleast i will keep it alive for all my life!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13d5e16f295de4c8f2540ea0aeb8f58b3ac2ebc0","amp;dn":"The+Legend+of+Zelda+Movie%3A+The+Hero+of+Time+%28fanmade%29+%28avi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13d5e16f295de4c8f2540ea0aeb8f58b3ac2ebc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,213,225,111,41,93,228,200,242,84,14,160,174,184,245,139,58,194,235,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
