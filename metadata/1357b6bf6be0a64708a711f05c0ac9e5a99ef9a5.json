This book assists all players in their efforts to improve, and provides fresh insights into the opening and early middlegame.\n\nRowson presents many new ideas on how Black should best combat White's early initiative, and make use of the extra information that he gains as a result of moving second. For instance, he shows that in some cases a situation he calls &quot;Zugzwang Lite&quot; can arise, where White finds himself lacking any constructive moves. He also takes a close look at the theories of two players who, in differing styles, have specialized in championing Black's cause: Mihai Suba and Andras Adorjan.\n\nReaders are also equipped with a &quot;mental toolkit&quot; that will enable them to handle many typical over-the-board situations with greater success, and avoid a variety of psychological pitfalls. Chess for Zebras offers fresh insights into human idiosyncrasies in all phases of the game. The depth and breadth of this book will therefore help players to appreciate chess at a more profound level, and make steps towards sustained and significant improvement.\n\n\n-- About the author --\n\nJonathan Rowson is an accomplished Grandmaster and Scotland's strongest ever player.
