So much so that they created a blog, thebookerycook.com, to celebrate their love of food. Instead of photographing their chosen dishes, however, they made contact with artists all over the world, who supplied dedicated artworks, in a huge variety of styles and media, to illustrate the recipes. This book will appeal to lovers of art as much as lovers of food, and will find its place equally in the kitchen or on the coffee table.\n\nAbout the Author\nJessica, Georgia and Maxine Thompson share a love of cooking and sharing food. They were raised in Queensland on a tropical hinterland farm, but are now based in Melbourne, Brisbane and New York respectively. Their blog, The Bookery Cook, explores cooking, creativity and community.\n\nCONTENTS\nCover\nTitle\nForeword\nIntroduction\nBreakfasts\nDips and pieces\nSoups\nMains\nBanquets\nSweets and treats\nAuthor and artist biographies\nAcknowledgements\nIndex\nCopyright","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c1e2e35ad68a80956f6af89f4bd3b51b1ffedca","amp;dn":"The+Bookery+Cook+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c1e2e35ad68a80956f6af89f4bd3b51b1ffedca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,30,46,53,173,104,168,9,86,246,175,137,244,189,59,81,177,255,237,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
