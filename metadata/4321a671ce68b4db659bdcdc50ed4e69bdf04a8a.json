It aims to provide a human response to human security matters. The work first shows how the Shield works to paralyze its audience. How can it be resisted? One response is to offer a warning about the hazards of bearing the Shield. After looking at thinkers such as Plato, Baudrillard, and Nietzsche, the work concludes with an examination of ekphrasis as a critical tool. With a unique and fresh perspective, &quot;The Poetics of Fear&quot; will be relevant to those interested in security studies and critical theoretical approaches to political science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4321a671ce68b4db659bdcdc50ed4e69bdf04a8a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+The+Poetics+of+Fear+A+Human+Response+to+Human+Secur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4321a671ce68b4db659bdcdc50ed4e69bdf04a8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,33,166,113,206,104,180,219,101,155,220,220,80,237,78,105,189,240,74,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
