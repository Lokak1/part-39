The full library spans the main topics in the chemical process industries that engineering professionals require a basic understanding of. They are â€˜pocket publicationsâ€™ that professional engineers can easily carry with them or access electronically while working.\r\n\r\nEach text is highly practical and applied, and presents first principles for engineers who need to get up to speed in a new area fast. The focused facts provided in each guide will help you converse with experts in the field, attempt your own initial troubleshooting, check calculations, and solve rudimentary problems.\r\n\r\nAdiabatic Fixed-bed Reactors covers the fundamentals of fixed-bed reactors, including various types and their physical properties. Applications of each device type are discussed, as well as trouble-shooting Solid-supported Catalysts. This text is ideal for any engineer who is new to working with fixed-bed reactors and needs to know the basics quickly and easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical, short, concise information on the basics will help you get an answer or teach yourself a new topic quickly\r\nSupported by industry examples to help you solve a real world problem\r\nSingle subject volumes provide key facts for professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e19b5ac6284b7e82a281fbd6872468b4b89bf89b","amp;dn":"Adiabatic+Fixed-Bed+Reactors+-+Practical+Guides+in+Chemical+Engi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e19b5ac6284b7e82a281fbd6872468b4b89bf89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,155,90,198,40,75,126,130,162,129,251,214,135,36,104,180,184,155,248,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
