It asks one simple question Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how will you die? \nIn the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable death day by day. No help is coming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their continued survival relies on their own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless horde. \n\nFeatures:\n========== CURRENT FEATURES:\nHardcore Sandbox Zombie Survival \nGame with a focus on realistic survival. \nOnline multiplayer survival with persistent player run servers. \nHundreds of zombies with swarm mechanics and in-depth visual and hearing systems. \nFull line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and visibility mechanics. Hide in the shadows, keep quiet and keep the lights off at night, or at least hang sheets over the windows. \nVast and growing map (loosely based on a real world location) for you to explore, loot and set up your fortress. Check out BlindcoderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s map project: http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ \nUse tools and items to craft weapons, barricade and cook. You can even build zombie proof forts by chopping trees, sawing wood and scavenging supplies. \nDeal with depression, boredom, hunger, thirst and illness while trying to survive. \nDay turns to night.
