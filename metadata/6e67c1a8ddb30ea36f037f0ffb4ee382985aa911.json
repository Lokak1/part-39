CNN called their coverage of the massacre a &quot;watershed&quot; moment in the network's history, but when it comes to acts of resistance here in the U.S., such as the Bundy Ranch standoff, CNN and other mainstream networks throw protestors under the bus. The mainstream media, however, is rapidly losing influence, and one former CBS correspondent even confirmed that the major networks are manipulated and controlled by the establishment. Moreover, the major networks provided near zero coverage of the recent Bilderberg meeting, and investigative reporter and author Daniel Estulin joins the show to break down why.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
