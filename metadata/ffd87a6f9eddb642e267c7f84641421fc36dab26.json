Bitwa warszawska 1920) is a Polish historical film directed by Jerzy Hoffman depicting the events of the Battle of Warsaw (1920) of the PolishÃ¢â‚¬â€œSoviet War as seen through the eyes of two young protagonists, Ola and Jan. She is a Warsaw cabaret dancer, while he is a cavalry officer and poet who believes in socialist ideals. It was released in September 2011. It was filmed in 3D using the Fusion Camera System.\n\n\nIMDb Rating: 4.3/10 from 936 users\nGenre: Drama | History | Musical\nLanguage: Polish | Russian\nRuntime: ~115 min\nAspect Ratio: 16:9, PAL\nResolution: 624x352\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: ~1360 kb/s\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 kbps\nSize: 700mb x 2\nSubtitles: PL, EN, DE, FR, ES, RUS\n\n\nThis is an unzipped and renamed/edited re-upload of the &quot;PROPER DVDRip XviD-AFO&quot; version (https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7006344/Battle_Of_Warsaw_1920_2011_PROPER_DVDRip_XviD-AFO). That torrent (of which there are 2 copies) sucks because it uses zip files, which don't even have a &quot;zip&quot; file ending, meaning you have to go through a slightly complicated procedure to be able to unzip the files. The other two available torrents sort of suck as well, the &quot;x264.DTS-WAF&quot; version has too many files for my liking. I suspect because it's DTS. The &quot;SWESUB.720p.BluRay.D&quot; version is 4.5GB! Despite that it's apparently bad quality as well.\n\nAnyways, so I decided to do a reupload since there are obviously people who want to download this movie. Unzipped and renamed. I left it as two 700MB files for those who like to burn their films to disc. Although who still does that now-a-days?! The unzipped subtitles are the English ones, the others are in the zip file. Thanks to the original uploader despite the crap &quot;format&quot;. :-)\n\nPS: I haven't watched the movie yet myself, just flicked through. Visiually it reminds me of TV Films/Dramas and the IMDB rating of 4/10 suggests it's ok, probably a movie you'll watch once and then delete, despite the very eye catching lead actress.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffd87a6f9eddb642e267c7f84641421fc36dab26","amp;dn":"Battle+Of+Warsaw+1920+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffd87a6f9eddb642e267c7f84641421fc36dab26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,216,122,111,158,221,182,66,226,103,199,248,70,65,66,31,195,109,171,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
