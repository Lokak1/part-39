This and many other burning questions trouble Jeremy Clarkson as he sets out to explore the world from the safety of four wheels. Avoiding the legions of power-crazed traffic wombles attempting to block highway and byway, he: * shows how the world of performance cars may be likened to Battersea dog's home * reveals why St Moritz may be the most bonkers town in all of the world * reminds us that Switzerland is so afraid of snow that any flakes falling on the road are immediately arrested * argues that washing a car is a waste of time Funny, globe-trotting, irreverent and sometimes downright rude, Round the Bend is packed with curious and fascinating but otherwise hopelessly useless stories and facts about everything under the sun (and just occasionally cars). It's Jeremy Clarkson at his brilliant best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b55df84c5a5d08635135031ed62a4ee192401e","amp;dn":"Round+the+Bend+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b55df84c5a5d08635135031ed62a4ee192401e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,181,93,248,76,90,93,8,99,81,53,3,30,214,42,78,225,146,64,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
