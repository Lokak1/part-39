They released an album that won over hearts and minds, and with their stage performances won some competitions and money allowing them to record an EP. This was to be the first collaboration with the indy producer Paul Schroeder, that went on to be called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the best indy record everÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by one reviewer.\nHappy but unfulfilled, the band recruited the rhythm skills of Daniel Kolind, whose background was more urban (he played with the highly influential Nobody Beats The Beats) and the Scarlet Chives sound was formed with Greany perfecting his soundscape guitars with Batz forging on with his angular guitar hooks and melodies (that have won him recognition in his own right as Sleep Party People), Lindahl adding his accomplished grand and purring keyboards, and Esben rooting it all together on bass. Mix this with the unique and beautiful sound of MortensenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice and what is created is a fragile organic yet thunderously climactic sound that transports the listener to a better place.\nThis world does need love and this is the band that delivers.\nThe band have just released their debut album, called Scarlet Chives, to critical acclaim, produced by the band and Paul Schroeder { Stone Roses, Verve, Campag Velocet } on the independent label Sureleaf.\n\nTracklist\n1\tSo Sing We\t4:32\n2\tThe Horror\t3:22\n3\tEasy Come Sit\t4:03\n4\tDon't You Put Your Hands There\t5:46\n5\tPainted On My Pillow\t5:46\n6\tScarlet Chives\t6:14\n7\tDancing\t3:31\n8\tSisters Playing In The Yard\t2:44\n9\tSomethings Never Change\t4:37\n10\tThoames\t4:57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50c73ea954eeb78f6f99e23fe89e05846fcb00b1","amp;dn":"Scarlet+Chives+-+Scarlet+Chives+%282011%29+%5B320k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50c73ea954eeb78f6f99e23fe89e05846fcb00b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,199,62,169,84,238,183,143,111,153,226,63,232,158,5,132,111,203,0,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
