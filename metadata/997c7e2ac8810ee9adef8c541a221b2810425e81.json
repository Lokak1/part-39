Some other information, such as Year, Genre, and Publisher may have been added if the information was available to me.\n\nFLAC cannot be encoded by my software in a usable fashion with tags, so you must add them yourself. I am using FreeRip right now, which does not create .cue or log files. Once I finish learning my way around EAC, I will switch over and my FLAC uploads will contain these files.\n\n\nAll albums will have album art included if it was available to me.\n\nAll MP3 files that I upload are encoded at TRUE 320 kbps.\n\nAll FLAC files that I upload are encoded at highest quality.  If the files seem a little large, that is why. \n\nIf you have any problems, comments, or suggestions, let me know. \n\nIF YOU NEED FOR ME TO RESEED, contact me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1467637d7260767b63546d757c7b7b3a777b79&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEnjoy, and seed, Seed, SEED!\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:997c7e2ac8810ee9adef8c541a221b2810425e81","amp;dn":"Morcheeba+-+Parts+Of+The+Process+-+MP3%2F320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"997c7e2ac8810ee9adef8c541a221b2810425e81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,124,126,42,200,129,14,233,173,239,140,84,26,34,27,40,16,66,94,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
