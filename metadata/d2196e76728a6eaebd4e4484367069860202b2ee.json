In what amounts to a 90-minute singalong with his adoring fans, the raw-voiced singer (now huskier than ever) reprises selections from throughout his long and fruitful career, from his early '70s solo albums, including the best of the lot, 1971's Every Picture Tells a Story, through his surprisingly skillful (and successful) new millennium emergence as an interpreter of the Great American Songbook. Despite his having released three CDs of standards by the time of this good-looking, great-sounding concert, only five of the 17 tunes come from them, including a version of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; with Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders (lush orchestration notwithstanding, there's no disguising the fact that both singers are more at home singing rock or pop than jazz, big band, or cabaret material). Much more emphasis is put on early Stewart material like &quot;You Wear It Well&quot;, &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, and &quot;Maggie May&quot; songs that were and are beautifully limned by acoustic guitars, violin, and mandolin. Good buddy, former bandmate (in the Faces and the Jeff Beck Group), and current Rolling Stone Ron Wood plays guitar on a couple of numbers (including a raucous &quot;Stay with Me&quot;), and while Stewart does insist on giving &quot;Hot Legs&quot; a spin, at the age of 59 he at least has the good sense to keep &quot;Do Ya Think I'm Sexy&quot; under wraps. A brief tour documentary is the principal DVD bonus feature.
