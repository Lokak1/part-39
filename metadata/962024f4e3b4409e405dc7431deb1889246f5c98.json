Ã¢â‚¬ËœTangramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ResoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much anticipated debut album was released in Nov 2012 and received heavy support from Mixmag (Album of the month), XLR8R, The Guardian, FACT, RA, NME, as well as other key musical luminaries such as Liam Howlett, Skrillex, Skream &amp; Benga, DJ Food, Salva, Rusko and more. A landmark thirteen track odyssey that reaffirms the place of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœalbumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ within modern electronic music, Tangram cemented Reso as one of the worlds most forward thinking producers\n\nTangram Remixed opens with KOAN Sound tackling 'Axion', pushing the tracks rhythmic possibilities yet further the OSWLA signed duo switch the glitching beat complexities into halftime stepping bliss. Remixer extraordinaire Om Unit perfectly balances 'Simple Pleasures' rich pads and dreamlike atmosphere with a slowfast footwork flux while Neurofunk god Billain delivers an exquisite and rare remix, a highly twisted take on the bass mechanics of 'Half Life'. Doshy closes the 12&quot; with his unique neck snapping electro and trap infused rework of 'Coronium'.\nThe digital package also includes revisions of 'Check 1,2' by PhiladelphiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Starkey (Amen breaks and 8 bar grime), 18 year old D&amp;B prodigy Emperor, MunichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Danny Scrilla (Sub heavy dark, sparse Ã¢â‚¬Ëœslower than it feelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 85bpm O.G '06 bass) and Japanese 2 x DMC world Champion DJ Kentaro (beat-juggling, electro-workout with more edits than you can count) Plus remixes of 'Ishimura' by NYC's Drop the Lime (Dark shuffling techno) and Atlanta's Evol Intent (hard hitting DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢B with a half time feel).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962024f4e3b4409e405dc7431deb1889246f5c98","amp;dn":"Reso+-+Tangram+Remixed+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962024f4e3b4409e405dc7431deb1889246f5c98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,32,36,244,227,180,64,158,64,93,199,67,29,235,24,137,36,111,92,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
