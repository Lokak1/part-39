When a new family settles into the rental trailer next door, Micky meets the young girl who will change her forever.\n\nDespite her deformed left leg and withered left hand, nine-year-old Leilani Klonk radiates a buoyant and indomitable spirit that inspires Micky. Beneath Leilani's effervescence, however, Micky comes to sense a quiet desperation that the girl dares not express. Leilani's mother is little more than a child herself, and her stepfather, Preston Maddoc, is educated but threatening. Slowly, ever more troubling details emerge in Leilani's conversations with Micky. Most chilling is Micky's discovery that Leilani had an older brother, also disabled, who vanished after Maddoc took him into the woods one night and is now &quot;gone to the stars&quot;.\n\nWhile the child-protection bureaucracy gives Micky the runaround, the Maddoc family slips away into the night. So Micky sets out across America to find them: for the first time living for something bigger than herself. One Door Away from Heaven is an incandescent mix of suspense and humor, fear and wonder, a story of redemption and timeless wisdom that will have listeners cheering.\n\n\nunabridged 21hrs 39min.\n\nazoozz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11ca8d15911be0edbbb436d9097a17bc8bf41573","amp;dn":"One+Door+Away+from+Heaven+by+Dean+Koontz+%5Bazoozz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11ca8d15911be0edbbb436d9097a17bc8bf41573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,202,141,21,145,27,224,237,187,180,54,217,9,122,23,188,139,244,21,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
