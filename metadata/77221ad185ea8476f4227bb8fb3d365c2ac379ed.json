He is a former member of the southern rock band, Outlaws, whom he joined in 1980, but left in 1983 to pursue a full-time career in Christian contemporary music, the year after, wherein he gained popularity throughout most the 1980s as a leather-jacket-wearing rocker with an arena rock sound featuring big, shout-along choruses. Upon signing to Reunion in 1988, his works began to take on a softer, more radio-friendly tone that included &quot;sentimental ballads and pop-rock anthems in the style of Michael Bolton.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - October 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77221ad185ea8476f4227bb8fb3d365c2ac379ed","amp;dn":"Rick+Cua+Discography+1982-1997+%288+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77221ad185ea8476f4227bb8fb3d365c2ac379ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,34,26,209,133,234,132,118,244,34,123,184,251,61,54,92,42,195,121,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
