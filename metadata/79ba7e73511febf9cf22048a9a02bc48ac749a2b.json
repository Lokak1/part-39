To make it short: some people billed this album ?a classic?, something I \ndonÃ‚Â´t really agree with. a debut album above average maybe, but a classic...? too many flaws and quirks to really call it ?a classic? \nbut, uh well, there you go. \n\nWhen asked for a possible reissue of the album, I thought ?why not iron out all those flaws and release the album the way I \nalways wanted it to be??. Thus I sat down, made many of the tracks leaner and condensed the sometimes aimless noodlings into \ntolerable length. in order to improve on the sometimes rather poor sound (again ho-hum), I remixed most of the tracks to restore \ntheir audio quality, using contemporary effects devices like tape echoes, spring reverbs or stereo chorus units. also, I had some \ntracks lying around in my archives which didnÃ‚Â´t make it onto the first version of ?traces? solely for space reasons. I decided \nto include them in order to make a ?directorÃ‚Â´s cut? version of ?Traces of the past?. I hope you enjoy listening to these new old \ntracks as much as I enjoyed compiling and editing them. and I wouldnÃ‚Â´t mind you calling it ?a classic? now. \n\n2007.
