As far as I can tell, nobody ever has, so I have ripped all of the LPs that I have, which represent 9 out of 11 official albums, not including the compendium album released in 1988 consisting entirely of material taken from previous albums, so no loss THERE.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The LPs are very old, and a couple of the ones I have are damaged or warped. Additionally, I do not have a great stereo / record player, or deep knowledge of the Sony Soundforge 9 program I used to try to clean these up. This means that the quality of the recordings is a VERY mixed bag. I am the first to admit that I am not happy with this torrent or its quality. In fact, some of the tracks are just about intolerable. I would not bother to post it at all, but even a mediocre / substandard set of recordings is better than none at all.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Wherever possible, I used the odd track I was able to hunt down on the old p2p networks taken either from someone who *DID* do a CD rip, or whose recording from THEIR old LP was superior to mine. Where this was not possible, I used the track I created as described. My efforts are done in 128kbps mono (my turntable wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t supply me with a stereo feed); with varying degrees of clicks, pops, and hisses either fixed or left intact. Improvement on this is/was beyond my abilities or equipment. Additionally, it sounds to me as if (on certain tracks) that the audio has been slowed down a tiny percentage. I have no idea why Soundforge would do this, since it never has on anything else I have used it for. Any advanced users who can explain this, please comment!\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The first two tracks are missing from the 1963 Think Ethnic! Album, because it was too badly warped to record. I do not have copies of the 1968 or 1969 albums, so the few tracks in those folders are from what little I could find on Limewire, gnutella, etc.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If anyone reading this either has or KNOWS someone who has these albums on CD, would you please for the love of G-D, get the damned things torrented - individually OR as a mass torrent! These were tremendously popular albums back in the day, and every one of them has been released on CD.\n\n\nOkay, now for the uninitiated, the Smothers Brothers were a folk music / comedy singing duo that came onto the scene in 1961, and remained fairly popular up until the current day. They had a popular television variety program from 1967-1969. The general gist of the jokes was the old ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“funny dumb guy, smart straight manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ routine, with dumb guy Tommy Smothers constantly interrupting smart guy Dick Smothers during songs with exasperating rants and bizarre commentary. Brothers in real life, they played up the concept of sibling rivalry with bits like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMom always liked YOU bestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and so forth. Better than decent musicians, they also through in a few straight folk songs to each album, and even recorded an album in 1966 consisting of nothing but regular music. They also released a childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s album based on AesopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fables in 1965.\n\nThere is a great deal of documentation and inside humor on each album, which is far too lengthy and detailed to be described in this torrent description. If you go to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smothers_Brothers#Discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smothers_Brothers#Discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\non Wikipedia, you will find an active link to complex notes on each album, and these are very much worth your time. So, I hope this torrent provides a lot of merriment to new fans and old, please DO NOT leave snotty comments griping about the missing files or mixed audio quality, and (again!) if anyone can torrent better copies, please do so and link here.\n\nRambam1776\n\nDiscography\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1961: Live at the Purple Onion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1962: The Two Sides of the Smothers Brothers\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1963: Think Ethnic!
