Several contributions come from elasticity theory. Areas covered include the theory of p-adic analysis, mappings of bounded mean oscillations, quasiconformal mappings of Klein surfaces, complex dynamics of inverse functions of rational or transcendental entire functions, the nonlinear Riemann-Hilbert problem for analytic functions with nonsmooth target manifolds, the Carleman-Bers-Vekua system, the logarithmic derivative of meromorphic functions, G-lines, computing the number of points in an arbitrary finite semi-algebraic subset, linear differential operators, explicit solution of first and second order systems in bounded domains degenerating at the boundary, the Cauchy-Pompeiu representation in L2 space, strongly singular operators of Calderon-Zygmund type, quadrature solutions to initial and boundary-value problems, the Dirichlet problem, operator theory, tomography, elastic displacements and stresses, quantum chaos, and periodic wavelets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae0af9b7fc8daf392dd0c012f310ff421c16534","amp;dn":"Topics+in+Analysis+and+its+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae0af9b7fc8daf392dd0c012f310ff421c16534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,224,175,155,127,200,218,243,146,221,12,1,47,49,15,244,33,193,101,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
