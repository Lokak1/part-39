Unger, published in 1996. Inspired by Peter Singer's 1971 essay &quot;Famine, Affluence, and Morality,&quot;[1] Unger argues that for people in the developed world to live morally, they are morally obliged to make sacrifices to help mitigate human suffering and premature death in the third world, and further that it is acceptable (and morally right) to lie, cheat, and steal to mitigate suffering.\nUnger argues that the intuitive moral judgments most people have of several hypothetical moral scenarios, The Shallow Pond, The Vintage Sedan, and The Envelope, are inconsistent.\nUnger presents the hypothetical case of The Vintage Sedan:\nNot truly rich, your one luxury in life is a vintage Mercedes sedan that, with much time, attention, and money, you've restored to mint condition... One day, you stop at the intersection of two small country roads, both lightly traveled. Hearing a voice screaming for help, you get out and see a man who's wounded and covered with a lot of his blood. Assuring you that his wound is confined to one of his legs, the man also informs you that he was a medical student for two full years. And, despite his expulsion for cheating on his second year final exams, which explains his indigent status since, he's knowledgeably tied his shirt near the wound as to stop the flow. So, there's no urgent danger of losing his life, you're informed, but there's great danger of losing his limb. This can be prevented, however, if you drive him to a rural hospital fifty miles away. &quot;How did the wound occur?&quot; you ask. An avid bird-watcher, he admits that he trespassed on a nearby field and, in carelessly leaving, cut himself on rusty barbed wire. Now, if you'd aid this trespasser, you must lay him across your fine back seat. But, then, your fine upholstery will be soaked through with blood, and restoring the car will cost over five thousand dollars. So, you drive away. Picked up the next day by another driver, he survives but loses the wounded leg.\nUnger reports that most people respond strongly that abandoning the hitchhiker is abominable behavior, and he contrasts this near-universal harsh judgment with the lenient judgments most people give to The Envelope:\nIn your mailbox, there's something from (the U.S. Committee for) UNICEF. After reading it through, you correctly believe that, unless you soon send in a check for $100, then, instead of each living many more years, over thirty more children will die soon.\nUnger argues that the factors that distinguish The Envelope from The Vintage Sedan, in which morality compels us to make a sacrifice, are not morally significant, using thought experiments such as variations on the trolley problem to illustrate his point. Unger contends that psychological factors obscure the moral questions, and that our moral intuitions about problems such as these provide an inconsistent window into our true moral values.\nUnger conspicuously indicates that the author's royalties from the sales of this book go to UNICEF and to Oxfam America.\n\n\n\n\nI created this with the text to speech voice neospeech bridget and though it is a high quality voice there will be a few pronunciation problems. \n\nEnjoy and let me know what you think :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e575f7f9607454a0897f97bdbce5021046ae3bc","amp;dn":"Peter+Ungor+-+Living+High+and+Letting+Die%3A+Our+Illusion+of+Innoc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e575f7f9607454a0897f97bdbce5021046ae3bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,87,95,127,150,7,69,74,8,151,249,123,219,206,80,33,4,106,227,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
