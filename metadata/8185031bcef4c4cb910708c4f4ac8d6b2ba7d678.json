The screenplay by Jeremy Brock and Andrew Davies is based on the 1945 novel of the same name by Evelyn Waugh, which previously had been adapted in 1981 as an eleven-episode television serial.\n\nCast\n\nEmma Thompson as Teresa Flyte, Marchioness of Marchmain (Lady Marchmain)\nMatthew Goode as Charles Ryder\nBen Whishaw as Lord Sebastian Flyte\nHayley Atwell as Lady Julia Flyte\nMichael Gambon as Alexander Flyte, Marquess of Marchmain (Lord Marchmain)\nGreta Scacchi as Cara\nPatrick Malahide as Mr. Ryder\nFelicity Jones as Lady Cordelia Flyte\nJonathan Cake as Rex Mottram\nJoseph Beattie as Anthony Blanche\nJames Bradshaw as Mr. Samgrass\n\nProduction\n\nActors Paul Bettany, Jude Law, and Jennifer Connelly were signed for the lead roles by original director David Yates for Warner Independent Pictures in 2004. However, constant budget issues stalled the film's production and Yates left the project to direct the fifth film in the Harry Potter series. This led to the roles being recast by directorial replacement Julian Jarrold.\n\nJust as it did for the earlier television adaptation of Waugh's novel, Castle Howard in North Yorkshire serves as the setting for Brideshead. In The World of Brideshead, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Simon Howard reveals his family was eager to welcome film crews to the estate once again. Given it became a major tourist attraction after the television serial aired, they hoped the feature film would renew interest in the property. Filming took place at Castle Howard during the summer of 2007, and many extras were employed from the local population in and around York.\n\nThe ending of the film was also altered from that of the novel. In the film, Charles leaves the family chapel at Brideshead seemingly unchanged in his atheist/agnostic leanings, although he decides not to snuff out the candle that is burning. The novel ends with Charles entering the chapel and kneeling down to pray using &quot;ancient and newly learned words,&quot; thus implying he has recently converted to Catholicism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8185031bcef4c4cb910708c4f4ac8d6b2ba7d678","amp;dn":"Brideshead+Revisited+%5B2008%5D+Emma+Thompson+%5B.x264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8185031bcef4c4cb910708c4f4ac8d6b2ba7d678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,133,3,27,206,244,196,203,145,7,8,196,244,172,141,107,43,167,214,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
