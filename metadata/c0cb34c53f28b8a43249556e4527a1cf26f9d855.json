Joe - Cobra Commander Tribute: 100-Page Spectacular (2011)\n\nCobra Annual 2012 - Origin of Cobra Commander\n\n------\n\nNow, about the &quot;VOLUME 3&quot; business ...\n\nG.I. Joe Cobra was a 4-issue miniseries in 2009.\n\nG.I. Joe Cobra II was a 4-issue mini in 2010. Sales were good and it continued as an ongoing, but issues 5 to 13 only said &quot;G.I. Joe Cobra&quot; on the covers.\n\nG.I. Joe Cobra, also known as &quot;Cobra Civil War&quot; for its first 8 issues, is the current volume. In the indicia it is called &quot;G.I. Joe Cobra vol. 2&quot;\n\nBut this really is the 3rd series, so that's what I've decided to call it.\n\nAll credit to the scanners. They include Cypher-Empire, Nahga-Empire, digital-Empire, G85-Empire, and probably some others. Enjoy and please seed to share with our friends at TPB!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0cb34c53f28b8a43249556e4527a1cf26f9d855","amp;dn":"COBRA+001-020+%282011-2012%29+%28IDW%29+%28volume+3%29+REQUESTED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0cb34c53f28b8a43249556e4527a1cf26f9d855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,203,52,197,63,40,184,164,50,73,85,110,69,39,161,207,38,249,216,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
