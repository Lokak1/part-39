Formed in 2001, it saw its origins when lead singer Janne Schra (born Janneke Maria Alie Schra) posted a note at Utrechts music College's message board seeking someone to write songs with. ArriÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«n Molema responded, and they started writing music together.\n\nIn August 2004 Tony Roe, Lucas Dols and Maarten Molema joined the group on the keys, double bass and the drums, respectively. That same year they played on the Uitmarkt of Amsterdam.\n\nThe debut album, produced by Floris Klinkert and Room Eleven, is called &quot;Six White Russians and a Pink Pussycat&quot; and was released on the 9th of June 2006. It was re-released in early 2007 with an additional bonus disc containing 2 versions of the song &quot;Bitch&quot;, a new song called &quot;Gray&quot; and some live versions of &quot;Greenest Grass&quot;, &quot;Sad Song&quot; and &quot;Come Closer&quot;.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, they were invited to perform at the Montreal International Jazz Festival.\n\nIn April 2008, they released their 2nd album, Mmm...Gumbo?\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
