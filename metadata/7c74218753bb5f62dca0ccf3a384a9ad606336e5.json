Though often referred to by the public as \n&quot;The Carpenters&quot; the duo's official name on authorized recordings and press materials is simply Carpenters \nwithout the definite article. During a period in the 1970s when louder and wilder rock was in great demand \nRichard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music \nartists of all time..\n\n\n   1.
