Hawkins - Beyond The Ordinary Interviews\n\nJuly 12th, 2005\n&quot;SerenityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n&quot;Serenity! That upsets me!&quot; as we have a HOOT of a time with Dr H. he explains maintaining serenity is a problem for many, taking one's self too seriously, making life drama.  Love what you do!  To be light hearted you recontexualize the entire field.  The &quot;Ultra Stupid&quot; story and owning your downside.  The brain and spiritual self aligned with essence, &quot;the humorists are really the healers of society ...there's an inner seriousness to humor, penetrating the illusion.&quot;  Intelligence is innate to life, &quot;Just look at a tiger's face, the design, a beautiful piece of art!&quot;  ...Oh, and a quote from Brocolli.\n\n\nJune 14th, 2005\n&quot;Conviction&quot;\n\nArising from your understanding not from outside, discovering a greater truth  ah!...now there is growth!

The &quot;Cultural Creatives&quot; and acquiring responsibility towards oneself, stewardship over your own life.\n\n\nApril 19th, 2005\n&quot;Alignment&quot;\n\nMost people think of love as romance, passion, involvement  ...rather, it is commonly possessive attraction, need, animal instinct, involving the solar plexus rather than the heart.  Real love calibrates at 500, it is alignment that surpasses baser instincts with purpose, the future or the relationship, concern for the happiness of another first, and spiritual intention.  Specialness, being homesick, and fear of loss.  Everything is transitory ... if you cling to things you will suffer.  The one sentence you need for a long term relationship, and what a cat would say if you asked him what is a cat?!

How to acquire rapid spiritual vision? Contemplate everything as a consequence of intention.\n\nJanuary 11th, 2005 \n&quot;The Meaning and Purpose of Life&quot;\n\nHis total revelation described and the eternal agony,  &quot;...my life is dedicated to find the truth regardless of the cost&quot;.
