They're lies. All lies.\nI've spent my life as an official adventurer. I travel across enchanted kingdoms saving magical creatures and fighting horrible beasts that most of you think are only myths and legends. I've never had a social life. My friends have all forgotten me. And let's not even talk about trying to do my homework. So -- I'm done!! I'm tired and I want to go back to being a normal girl. But then along comes &quot;Prince Charming&quot; asking for help, and, well, what's a tired girl like me supposed to do?\n&quot;Jenny is an adventurer I'd definitely want in my corner if my life ever took a wrong turn from Happily Ever After.&quot; -- Helene Boudreau, author of Real Mermaids Don't Wear Toe Rings\n&quot;Readers will laugh their way through the ups and downs of Jenny's many (mis)adventures.&quot; -- Jennifer A. Nielsen, author of Elliot and the Goblin War","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c809b7f4da9be1c51acb61f8d44da45d61ad76","amp;dn":"My+Very+UnFairy+Tale+Life+-+Anna+Staniszewski","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0c809b7f4da9be1c51acb61f8d44da45d61ad76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,200,9,183,244,218,155,225,197,26,203,97,248,212,77,164,93,97,173,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
