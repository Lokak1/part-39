Human factors are now recognized as being at the core of aviation safety and the training syllabus that flight crew trainees have to follow reflects that. This book will help student pilots pass exams in human performance and limitations, successfully undergo multi-crew cooperation training and crew resource management (CRM) training, and prepare them for assessment in non-technical skills during operator and license proficiency checks in the simulator, and during line checks when operating flights.\r\n\r\nEach chapter begins with an explanation of the relevant science behind that particular subject, along with mini-case studies that demonstrate its relevance to commercial flight operations. Of particular focus are practical tools and techniques that students can learn in order to improve their performance as well as &quot;training tips&quot; for the instructor.\r\n\r\nProvides practical, evidence-based guidance on issues often at the root of aircraft accidents\r\nUses international regulatory material\r\nIncludes concepts and theories that have practical relevance to flight operations\r\nCovers relevant topics in a step-by-step manner, describing how they apply to flight operations\r\nDemonstrates how human decision-making has been implicated in air accidents and equips the reader with tools to mitigate these risks\r\nGives instructors a reliable knowledge base on which to design and deliver effective training\r\nSummarizes the current state of human factors, training, and assessment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af92804f3aa51c8030bb5e1824e5e1d953cc0a9d","amp;dn":"Practical+Human+Factors+for+Pilots+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af92804f3aa51c8030bb5e1824e5e1d953cc0a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,146,128,79,58,165,28,128,48,187,94,24,36,229,225,217,83,204,10,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
