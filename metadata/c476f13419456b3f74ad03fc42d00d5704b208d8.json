They meet back in Iceland for a holiday that changes both their lives.\n\nThe comedy Our Own Oslo is an everyday love story. We follow the strained courtship of the wildly differing Harald, forty year old engineer, and Vilborg, an unemployed single mother. They are both tangled up in their own pasts and their attempts at love end in disaster. The humor in the movie is often black and firmly tied to the commonplace, but the compassion lies with the main characters who are trying their best.\n\nThe beautiful Icelandic countryside is the opposite of the common drone of ReykjavÃƒÂ­k city, the loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled, awkward courtship is the opposite of the magical world of Oslo, where the two met while traveling, in a sense on leave from their normal lives.\n\nHarald and Vilborg are normal people we all know. They have their strengths and weaknesses. They make some questionable decisions, are often unlucky and clumsy at communication, but like the rest of us they are driven on by the simple quest for a better life, companionship, love and happiness.\n\n\nDVDRip XviD MP3 Avi - 640 x 336 - 94 min\n\n\nThe film is in Icelandic language with English subtitles.\n\n\nIf you like it: Buy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c476f13419456b3f74ad03fc42d00d5704b208d8","amp;dn":"Okkar+eigin+Osl%26oacute%3B+%5BOur+Own+Oslo%5D+%282011%29+Reynir+Lyngdal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c476f13419456b3f74ad03fc42d00d5704b208d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,118,241,52,25,69,107,63,116,173,3,252,66,208,13,87,4,178,8,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
