The result is the decidedly real rock &amp; roll of Ghosts &amp; Compromise: 11 tracks that echo the undying influence the original indie bands have had on a generations of twangy dreamers. The immediacy of Waiting For Henry's debut was aptly captured by Bob Rice of Crossroad on KYRS (Spokane, WA)... &quot;#&amp;^#%ing Jesus, these guys rock! I love the whole sound... REM meets the Jayhawks.&quot;\n\nLed by former Mr. Henry (EMI/Deep South) alt-rocker Dave Slomin on lead vocal &amp; guitar, Waiting For Henry includes Dave Ashdown (Dashdown) on drums, guitar &amp; vocals and veteran NYC bassist, Michael Chun (Hot Lava)..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d904da0f04e023c843145252f037bced74b025aa","amp;dn":"Waiting+for+Henry+-+Ghosts+%26amp%3B+Compromise+%5B2013%5D+%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d904da0f04e023c843145252f037bced74b025aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,4,218,15,4,224,35,200,67,20,82,82,240,55,188,237,116,176,37,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
