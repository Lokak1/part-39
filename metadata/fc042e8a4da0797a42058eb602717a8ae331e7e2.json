DEAD BEES ON A CAKE is the culmination of all his previous efforts, offering a perfect blend of unconventionality and accessibility.\n\nAs on Sylvian's previous albums, there's a combination of jazz, ambient and world music influences, but one new wrinkle is a distinct R&amp;B flavor on several tracks, as evidenced by the syncopated drum loops and punchy rhythm guitar accents. Sylvian's in no danger of becoming the avant garde R. Kelly, though--&quot;All of My Mother's Names&quot; is a blazing modern jazz instrumental, while &quot;Pollen Path&quot; is an outre affair that boasts a John Cage sample. \n\nSylvian's Buddhist faith informs most of the lyrics, and undoubtedly inspired the Eastern modalities that crop up throughout. Of course, his deep, smooth voice is as rich and inviting an instrument as ever. A challenging album that defies expectations, DEAD BEES is both strikingly unusual and warmly engaging.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - I Surrender\n02 - Dobro #1\n03 - Midnight Sun\n04 - Thalhiem\n05 - God Man\n06 - Alphabet Angel\n07 - Krishna Blue\n08 - The Shining Of Things\n09 - Cafe Europa\n10 - Pollen Path\n11 - All Of My Mother's Names\n12 - Wanderlust\n13 - Praise\n14 - Darkest Dreaming\n\n*1999 Virgin Records | CDV 2876 / 7243 8 47071 2 5\n\n\n\nPersonnel: \n\nDavid Sylvian (vocals, acoustic &amp; electric guitars, keyboards, bass, programming, samples); Shree Maa, Ingrid Chavez (vocals); Marc Ribot (acoustic, electric &amp; slide guitars); Bill Frisell (acoustic guitar, dobro); Lawrence Feldman (flute); Deepak Ram (Bansuri flute); Kenny Wheeler (flugelhorn); Ryuichi Sakamoto (Fender Rhodes piano, loops, samples); Tommy Barbarella (Fender Rhodes piano); Chris Minh Doky (acoustic bass); John Giblin (bass); Ged Lynch, Scooter Warner (drums); Steve Jansen (cymbals, percussion, loops); Talvin Singh (tabla, percussion); Steve Tibbetts (gong).\n\n\n\nSome David Sylvian Albums...\n\n\nDavid Sylvian &amp; Robert Fripp - Damage (1994) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11565521/David_Sylvian__amp__Robert_Fripp_-_Damage_%281994%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11565521/David_Sylvian__amp__Robert_Fripp_-_Damage_%281994%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRobert Fripp &amp; Brian Eno - No Pussyfooting (1973) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11589447/Robert_Fripp__amp__Brian_Eno_-_No_Pussyfooting_%281973%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11589447/Robert_Fripp__amp__Brian_Eno_-_No_Pussyfooting_%281973%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Brilliant Trees (1984) [EAC-FLAC]:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11088946/David_Sylvian_-_Brilliant_Trees_%281984%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11088946/David_Sylvian_-_Brilliant_Trees_%281984%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Alchemy An Index Of Possibilities (1985) [EAC-FLAC]:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11090291/David_Sylvian_-_Alchemy_An_Index_Of_Possibilities_%281985%29_%5BEAC-FL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11090291/David_Sylvian_-_Alchemy_An_Index_Of_Possibilities_%281985%29_%5BEAC-FL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Gone To Earth (1986) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11095709/David_Sylvian_-_Gone_To_Earth_%281986%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11095709/David_Sylvian_-_Gone_To_Earth_%281986%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Secrets Of The Beehive (1987) [EAC-FLAC]:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11101488/David_Sylvian_-_Secrets_Of_The_Beehive_%281987%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11101488/David_Sylvian_-_Secrets_Of_The_Beehive_%281987%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nDavid Sylvian &amp; Holger Czukay - Plight &amp; Premonition (1988) [EAC-FLAC]:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11102528/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Plight__amp__Premonition_%2819&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11102528/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Plight__amp__Premonition_%2819&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian &amp; Holger Czukay - Flux + Mutability (1989) [EAC-FLAC]:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11157011/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Flux___Mutability_%281989%29_%5BEA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11157011/David_Sylvian__amp__Holger_Czukay_-_Flux___Mutability_%281989%29_%5BEA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
