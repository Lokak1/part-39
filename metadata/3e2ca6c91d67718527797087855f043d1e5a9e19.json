But peace has been exacted at a terrible price ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a pact made with a hidden power whose motives are at best suspect, at worst deadly.\n\nTo the south, the expansionist kingdom of Lether has devoured all of its less-civilised neighbours with rapacious, cold-blooded hunger. All, that is, save one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Tiste Edur. For Lether is approaching a long-prophesied renaissance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from kingdom and lost colony of the First Empire to Empire reborn. And so its people have fixed their avid gazes northward, to the rich and abundant lands and coasts of the Tiste Edur. And beneath the suffocating weight of gold, or by slaughter at the edge of a sword, it seems the Tiste Edur must fall. Or so Destiny has decreed.\n\nWar and betrayal, magic and myth collide in this, the stunning fifth chapter in Steven EriksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s magnificent Malazan Book of the Fallen sequence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a monumental achievement that is being hailed by readers and critics alike as an epic of the imagination and a fantasy classic in the making.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e2ca6c91d67718527797087855f043d1e5a9e19","amp;dn":"Malazan+Book+of+the+Fallen+05+-+Midnight+Tides-Steven+Erikson+-v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e2ca6c91d67718527797087855f043d1e5a9e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,44,166,201,29,103,113,133,39,121,112,135,133,95,4,61,30,90,158,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
