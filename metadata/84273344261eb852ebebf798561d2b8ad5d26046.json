He volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown and was discharged. In 1933, his work was branded as &quot;degenerate&quot; by the Nazis and in 1937 over 600 of his works were sold or destroyed. In 1938 he committed suicide by gunshot.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84273344261eb852ebebf798561d2b8ad5d26046","amp;dn":"Ernst+Ludwig+Kirchner+-+a+Retrospective+Exhibition+%28Art+Ebook%29.p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84273344261eb852ebebf798561d2b8ad5d26046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,39,51,68,38,30,184,82,235,235,247,152,86,29,43,138,213,210,96,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
