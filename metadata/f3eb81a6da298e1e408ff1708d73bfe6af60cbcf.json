For the follow-up Nocturne, Tatum headed to the Rare Book Room to work with producer Nicolas Vernhes, and together the two crafted an album that takes Wild Nothing's sound out of the bedroom, dresses it in fancy clothing, and manages to be just as impressive. The overall sound of the album is much more layered and smooth; Tatum's bathed-in-warm-reverb voice is even lower in the mix, the guitars chime and ring but are rarely spiky, and the keyboards are more atmospheric than before. Another change on Nocturne is the live drums, which give the sound a boost in energy and power. The album's richly textured sound is a perfect match for the kind of relaxed and tuneful songs that dominate, Tatum and Vernhes focus the songs emotionally and sonically into an overall package that sounds lovely and has some real depth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3eb81a6da298e1e408ff1708d73bfe6af60cbcf","amp;dn":"Wild+Nothing+-+Nocturne+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3eb81a6da298e1e408ff1708d73bfe6af60cbcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,235,129,166,218,41,142,30,64,143,241,112,141,115,191,230,175,96,203,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
