The idea this time around was to hook him up with producer Dick Shurman and get Slim to record tunes he hadn't committed to wax yet. With a tight version of the Teardrops aboard (the ubiquitous Nick Holt on bass and vocals, Michael Dotson on rhythm, Allen Kirk on drums, and Slim's son Shawn Holt making a guest appearance on &quot;Young Man's Blues&quot;), Slim turns in a solid effort here. But perhaps the biggest change this time around is the inclusion of four original tunes from Slim, big news for a combo that many consider to be the ultimate blues cover band. Counting Nick Holt's &quot;Playin' with My Mind&quot; and Shawn Holt's &quot;Young Man's Blues,&quot; \n\nTracklist\n\n  1. Jealous Man 3:11\n  2. Wake Me Up Early 3:16\n  3. Still A Fool 5:23\n  4. Black Tornado (Instrumental) 2:54\n  5. Playin' With My Mind 3:02\n  6. I Can't Trust My Woman 5:26\n  7. Magic Boogie 3:16\n  8. You Got Bad Intentions 3:09\n  9. Crazy Woman 5:48\n10. Young Man's Blues 3:44\n11. It's Alright 3:54\n12. Love Like I Wanna 3:30\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2491b5cfd257b0acdc4869233ca538e4c6f1c67","amp;dn":"Magic+Slim+and+The+Teardrops+Black+Tornado%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2491b5cfd257b0acdc4869233ca538e4c6f1c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,73,27,92,253,37,123,10,205,196,134,146,51,202,83,142,76,111,28,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
