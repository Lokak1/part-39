Created by Albert Kanter, the series began publication in 1941 and finished its first run in 1971, producing 169 issues. Following the demise of the series, various companies reprinted its titles.\n\nMarvel began publishing MARVEL CLASSICS COMICS, their own full color classic novel adaptations, with DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE in 1976. In all, 36 of them were produced and they were generally well drawn and well interpreted. Some gaffes were made - H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon was attributed to Jules Verne and The Cyclops in HomerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Odyssey was drawn as horned and purple - Marvel simply couldn't stop drawing outlandish, out of this world monsters! Most of the titles had appeared in the Classics Illustrated series but two new ones were adapted - H. Rider HaggardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s She and Bram StokerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dracula. After two years, the series ended.\n\n------\n\n01 Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde\n02 The Time Machine\n03 The Hunchback of Notre Dame\n04 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\n05 Black Beauty\n06 GulliverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Travels\n07 Tom Sawyer\n08 Moby Dick\n09 Dracula\n10 Red Badge of Courage\n11 Mysterious Island\n12 The Three Musketeers\n13 Last of the Mohicans\n14 War of the Worlds\n15 Treasure Island\n16 Ivanhoe\n17 Count of Monte Cristo\n18 The Odyssey\n19 Robinson Crusoe\n20 Frankenstein\n21 Master of the World\n22 Food of the Gods\n23 The Moonstone\n24 She\n25 The Invisible Man\n26 The Illiad\n27 Kidnapped\n28 The Pit and the Pendulum\n29 Prisoner of Zenda\n30 Arabian Nights\n31 First Men in the Moon\n32 White Fang\n33 Prince and the Pauper\n34 Robin Hood\n35 Alice in Wonderland\n36 A Christmas Carol\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5472699e2cfec6c8309a371ee3883a4d1e4c821","amp;dn":"MARVEL+CLASSICS+COMICS+%281976-1978%29+All+36+Issues+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5472699e2cfec6c8309a371ee3883a4d1e4c821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,71,38,153,226,207,236,108,131,9,163,113,238,56,131,164,209,228,200,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
