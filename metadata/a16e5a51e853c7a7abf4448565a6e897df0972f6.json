Majestic. Storied. Texas. \r\nThe Lone Star State has many traditions, among them its homegrown cuisine, which Texans have always been justly proud of, and which has been gaining followers--and respect--all over the country. The Reata restaurants have an honored place in this emerging culinary story. Reata: Legendary Texas Cuisine tells the tale of one American family that, against the breathtaking backdrop of Texas, took risks, worked hard, and dreamed big. \r\n \r\nToday the pride of the Micallef family are its two Reata restaurants, the original location in the tiny West Texas town of Alpine, and its much larger sibling in Fort Worth. Reata pays homage to Americaâ€™s cowboys and the values they have come to symbolize by promoting the traditional ideals of integrity, generosity, and hospitality with an easy ambience, exciting dishes, and exceptional service. \r\n \r\nThe Reata menus combine familiar Texas fare with fresh culinary trends, including signature favorites, like the pepper-crusted tenderloin, the golden chicken-fried steaks, and the tenderloin tamales. Adventurous cooks will want to try the buffalo rib eye and the smoked quail, as well as some of the more surprising pairings, such as the boar ribs with a Thai-inspired spicy peanut dipping sauce. And no Reata cookbook would be complete without the fiery jalapeÃ±o cheese grits or the unrivaled â€œGiantâ€ onion rings.\r\n \r\nSo if you canâ€™t drop by one of the restaurants and set a spell, Reata: Legendary Texas Cuisine will give you a taste of Reata thatâ€™s as big and bold as the state of Texas itself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16e5a51e853c7a7abf4448565a6e897df0972f6","amp;dn":"Reata+-+Legendary+Texas+Cooking+%282011%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16e5a51e853c7a7abf4448565a6e897df0972f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,110,90,81,232,83,199,167,171,244,68,133,101,166,232,151,223,9,114,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
