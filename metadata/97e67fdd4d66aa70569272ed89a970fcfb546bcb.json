A Movement Lost In Twilight Stone 02:22\n09. Political Machine 03:44\n10. Opal Pyramid Drifting Over Time 08:03\n\nTotal: 33:34\n\nOne of the most unconventional albums ever recorded, this avant-garde psychedelic suite contains elements of folk, jazz, rock and electronica, but has a sound and atmosphere all of its own. Recorded in 1970, but barely released (despite the enthusiastic support of John Peel), original copies now sell for astronomical sums. This is its long-awaited CD debut, and comes complete with comprehensive liner notes and rare photographs. Guest performers also include Rik Kenton (later Roxy Music) and Geoff Leigh (later Gong, Kevin Ayers, Henry Cow).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e67fdd4d66aa70569272ed89a970fcfb546bcb","amp;dn":"G.F.+Fitz-Gerald+-+Mouseproof+%281970%2F2006%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e67fdd4d66aa70569272ed89a970fcfb546bcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,230,127,221,77,102,170,112,86,146,114,237,137,169,112,252,251,84,107,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
