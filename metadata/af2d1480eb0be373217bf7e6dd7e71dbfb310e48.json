Runeii (4:59)\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nLaughing Stock is the fifth and final studio album by Talk Talk. Released in 1991, it was the only album the band released on the jazz-based Verve Records, after acrimoniously leaving EMI.\n\nLike its predecessor, Spirit of Eden, the album featured improvised instrumentation from a large ensemble of musicians, including as many as seven violists on occasion, and the lyrical themes are often religious. The recording sessions have attained near-mythical status among underground music fans; Tape Op magazine ran an extensive article detailing the demanding recording sessions, marked by Mark Hollis' perfectionist tendencies, and his use of candles and incense to set the mood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af2d1480eb0be373217bf7e6dd7e71dbfb310e48","amp;dn":"Talk+Talk+-+Laughing+Stock+%281991%29+FLAC+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af2d1480eb0be373217bf7e6dd7e71dbfb310e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,45,20,128,235,11,227,115,33,123,247,230,221,126,113,219,251,49,14,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
