The only thing I did to it was rearrange the audio tracks so Dolby True HD was the default track; and muxed it into a .mkv container.\n\nExtras have not been added.\n\nMy first up, hope you like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b743365d8dd5d9588deb9a1c1c668798eeea663","amp;dn":"Sunshine+Daydream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b743365d8dd5d9588deb9a1c1c668798eeea663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,116,51,101,216,221,93,149,136,222,185,161,193,198,104,121,142,238,166,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
