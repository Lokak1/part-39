Every game in this torrent has been played and tested and works fine on the BlackBerry 8300. All games are full screen, with sound, and all use the trackball for control.\n\nThese games are already widely available in other torrents, this collection however has been tested and verified as working on the BlackBerry 8300. Other torrents contain a mishmash of BB applications and games with poor compatibility, on average I found that about half of the games worked properly on the 8300. Some games have the wrong screen size, some don't use the trackball, etc.\n\nThis collection has been cleaned up and tested. All of the files have been renamed and the ALX files have been edited to clean up the filenames and descriptions. This means that, where possible, games will actually show up as &quot;Bionic Commando Rearmed&quot; instead of something like &quot;bb8818_bionic_commando_all&quot;.\n\nFinally, these games may be compatible on BlackBerry models other than 8300 (that also have a screen resolution of 320x240), however your mileage may vary.\n\nLIST OF GAMES:\n--------------\n\n - Bejeweled\n - Bionic Commando Rearmed\n - Bust-A-Move\n - Cranium\n - Disco Bowling\n - Guitar Hero 3\n - Guitar Hero World Tour\n - Lemmings Tribes\n - Pirate Ship Battles\n - Poker Blast\n - Pub Checkers\n - Pyramid Bloxx\n - Rollercoaster Rush\n - Spore\n - Street Fighter 2\n - Sudoku\n - The Sims 3\n - Tiki Towers\n - Tower Bloxx\n\nINSTALLATION:\n-------------\n\n1.
