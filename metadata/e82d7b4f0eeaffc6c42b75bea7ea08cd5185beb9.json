The Story of Stuff is a 20-minute, fast-paced, fact-filled look at the underside of our production and consumption patterns. The Story of Stuff exposes the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues, and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world. It&amp;#039;ll teach you something, it&amp;#039;ll make you laugh, and it just may change the way you look at all the stuff in your life forever.\n\nThis is also available from www.storyofstuff.com\n\nThough the site appears to be down, so i figured i may as well upload it. \n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e82d7b4f0eeaffc6c42b75bea7ea08cd5185beb9","amp;dn":"Story+of+Stuff+with+Annie+Leonard+-+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e82d7b4f0eeaffc6c42b75bea7ea08cd5185beb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,45,123,79,14,234,255,198,196,43,117,190,167,234,8,205,81,133,190,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
