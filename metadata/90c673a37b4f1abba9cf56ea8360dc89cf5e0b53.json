In Our Family Wedding, they learn the hard way that the path to saying `I do` can be rife with familial strife. When they return from college and too suddenly announce their marriage plans, they soon discover that their fathers - two highly competitive over-the-top egos - can wreak a major amount of havoc on their special day. With insults flying and tempers running high, it`s anyone`s guess if the alpha dads will survive to make it down the aisle in one piece. Lucia`s mother is busy planning the wedding of `her` dreams and the only levelheaded one in the bunch is Angela, the groom's father's best friend and lawyer, who manages to keep her cool when the madness reaches a crescendo. With only weeks to plan their wedding, Lucia and Marcus soon discover the true meaning of love and find there is truth to the saying - that when you marry someone, you marry their entire family.\n\nCats :\nForest Whitaker\t ... \tBrad Boyd\nAmerica Ferrera\t... \tLucia Ramirez\nCarlos Mencia\t... \tMiguel Ramirez\nRegina King\t... \tAngela\nLance Gross\t... \tMarcus Boyd\nDiana Maria Riva\t... \tSonia Ramirez\t\nLupe Ontiveros\t... \tMomma Cecilia\nAnjelah N.
