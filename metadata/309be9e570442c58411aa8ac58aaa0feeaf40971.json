Transistor Revolution, our virtual analogue drum machine inspired by the classic TR-808 and TR-909 electronic drum machines of the 1980Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\nWhy 22,000 samples you might ask? To give an example of the detail involved in the sampling of each instrument, the Revolution 909 Bass Drum alone uses 9318 unique sounds to faithfully recreate the 909 Bass Drum sound. Each of the 4 knobs on the Revolution 909 Bass Drum control panel scans smoothly through each and every sample in real-time... Additionally to emulate the subtle differences in sound inherent of analogue equipment we recorded 7 variations of each drum sound which cycle randomly each time a key on the keyboard is played.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309be9e570442c58411aa8ac58aaa0feeaf40971","amp;dn":"Wave.Alchemy.Transistor.Revolution.KONTAKT-SYNTHiC4TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309be9e570442c58411aa8ac58aaa0feeaf40971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,155,233,229,112,68,44,88,65,26,168,172,88,170,160,254,234,244,9,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
