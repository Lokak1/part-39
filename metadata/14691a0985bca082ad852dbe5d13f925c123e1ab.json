I know.\n\nThe Story:\n When I was a wee lad, my mother had a cassette tape called\n &quot;Monte Video &amp; The Cassettes&quot;, which was one of her favorite tapes.\n She listened to it all the time, and I grew very fond of it,\n but unfortunately, the tape got lost in a move.\n I tried to find them on the internet for years, but to no avail.\n Finally, years later it was found in a box, but was in rough shape.\n We tried playing it, but everything was dragged and distorted.\n I thought to myself: &quot;Hey, I bet someone has this on eBay!&quot;\n Well, I didn't find the cassette, but I got one even better; the record!\n It was in excellent condition, and my mom was excited to listen to it,\n but I told her &quot;No, wait! We have to record it to MP3!&quot;\n I bought a 3.5mm audio cable and a 5.3mm converter,\n downloaded some software, and BAM! Here we are!\n\ntl;dr version:\n Monte Video wasn't on the internet before. Now it is. You're welcome.\n\nSomeone told me there's also a song called &quot;Don't Mention My Name&quot; somewhere...\nIf anyone knows anything about that, let me know.\n\nUploaded by\n\n    .#### #   # .###  ####  ##### ##### .###  ####  ####\n   #`    ##  # #`  # #   #   #     .#` #`  # #   # #  `#\n  # .## # # # ##### ####`   #    .#`  ##### ####` #   #\n #   # #  ## #   # #   #   #   .#`   #   # #   # #  .#\n #### #   # #   # #   # ##### ##### #   # #   # ####`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14691a0985bca082ad852dbe5d13f925c123e1ab","amp;dn":"Monte+Video+%26+The+Cassettes+-+Monte+Video+%28Vinyl+Record+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14691a0985bca082ad852dbe5d13f925c123e1ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,105,26,9,133,188,160,130,173,133,45,190,93,19,249,37,193,35,225,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
