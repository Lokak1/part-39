Paul Muni, Marguerite Chapman, Larry Parks, George Macready\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037618/\r\n\r\n\r\nIn German-occupied Russia, Russian engineers are building a bridge beneath the surface of a river in preparation for a Soviet counter-attack on the German forces. Two of the Russians, soldier Alexei Kulkov and navigator Lisa Elenko, become trapped underground with a group of German soldiers. Having recently witnessed a colleague's skillful interrogation of a Nazi prisoner, Kulkov tries to prod the enemy soldiers into sharing details about Berlin's strategy. But one of the Germans is just as shrewd. The film was made during the brief period after World War II when Russia and the USA were allies and the political overtones of the film were unintentional.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 720x540, 25.000 fps, 953 Kbps, 01h30m05s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 64 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nRatio: 4:3\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio English and Spanish, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/ioed6j881/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/dfhvbw1jr/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/u4jb7sy53/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/yrtynbavr/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/ujz6ek9g7/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f80cb770c5d495ec765c57e87ed938f6a9a442d","amp;dn":"Counter-Attack+-+aka+One+Against+Seven+%5B1945+-+USA%5D+WWII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f80cb770c5d495ec765c57e87ed938f6a9a442d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,128,203,119,12,93,73,94,199,101,197,126,135,237,147,143,106,154,68,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
