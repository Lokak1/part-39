Though the quality isn't anything to brag about (then again, really none of the V.U. bootlegs aren't that good quality wise), it's a great collection of some of their performances, possibly the best official Live release from the band so far (I hope they continue the &quot;Bootleg Series&quot; again sometime), even better than &quot;1969 Live&quot;.\n\nEnjoy, and be sure to seed.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc One (The Family Dog show; November 7 - 9, 1969)\n\n1.&quot;I'm Waiting for the Man&quot; (November 8, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:46\n2.&quot;It's Just Too Much&quot; (November 8, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n3.&quot;What Goes On&quot; (November 8, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:25\n4.&quot;I' Can't Stand It&quot; (November 8, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:20\n5.&quot;Some Kinda Love&quot; (November 8, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48\n6.&quot;Foggy Notion&quot; (November 8, 1969) (Sterling Morrison, Doug Yule, Maureen Tucker, Hy Weiss) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:41\n7.&quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (November 7, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n8.&quot;After Hours&quot; (November 8, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05\n9.&quot;I'm Sticking with You&quot; (November 8, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n10.&quot;Sunday Morning&quot; (November 9, 1969) (Reed, John Cale) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56\n11.&quot;Sister Ray&quot; (November 7, 1969) (Reed, Cale, Morrison, Tucker) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 24:03\n\n\nDisc Two (The Matrix show; November 23 - December 3, 1969)\n\n1.&quot;Follow the Leader&quot; (November 27, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 17:05\n2.&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; (December 1, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:03\n3.&quot;Venus in Furs&quot; (December 1, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:14\n4.&quot;Heroin&quot; (November 23, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:11\n5.&quot;Sister Ray&quot; (December 3, 1969) (Reed, Cale, Morrison, Tucker) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 38:00\n\n\nDisc Three (Tracks 1 - 6 at The Matrix show; November 23 - 27, 1969)\n(Track 7 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri; May 11, 1969)\n\n1.&quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (November 25, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:49\n2.&quot;New Age&quot; (November 24, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:21\n3.&quot;Over You&quot; (November 25, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:41\n4.&quot;The Black Angel's Death Song&quot; (November 23, 1969) (Reed, Cale) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:54\n5.&quot;I'm Waiting for the Man&quot; (November 27, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:37\n6.&quot;Ride into the Sun&quot; (November 24, 1969) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:11\n7.&quot;Sister Ray&quot;/&quot;Foggy Notion&quot; (May 11, 1969) (Reed, Cale, Morrison, Tucker/Morrison, Yule, Tucker, Weiss) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 28:43\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00d590aab8f94ec98162ddeb68c984ce60c812bd","amp;dn":"The+Velvet+Underground+-+The+Quine+Tapes+%28%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00d590aab8f94ec98162ddeb68c984ce60c812bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,213,144,170,184,249,78,201,129,98,221,235,104,201,132,206,96,200,18,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
