Cool Projects that is, we've got a Linux powered rocket and a Linux powered submarine. Plus we show you how to use the iRobot Create with Linux, how to convert those old 8mm movies to DVD with Linux, and how to control your house with Linux and Mi Casa Verde. After checking out the cool projects don't miss the rest of this cool issue and read how to run Rails under Apache using Phusion Passenger, how to build a secure Squid Web Proxy, how to use OpenFiler to create an open-source network storage appliance, and if just typed &quot;rm -rf /&quot; find out what to do and what not to do in our continuing series of &quot;When Disaster Strikes&quot; articles.
