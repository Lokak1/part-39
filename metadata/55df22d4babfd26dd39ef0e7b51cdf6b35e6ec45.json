Its lively, informal style brings metaphysical questions to life and shows how stimulating it can be to think about them.\n\nEarl Conee and Theodore Sider offer a lucid discussion of the major topics in metaphysics. What makes me the same person I was as a child? Is everything fated to be exactly as it is? Does time flow? How fast does it flow, and can one travel back in time, against the current? Does God exist? Why is there anything at all rather than nothing? If our actions are caused by things science can predict and control, how can we have free will? The authors approach these topics in an open-minded and non-dogmatic manner, giving students a full sense of the issues involved","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55df22d4babfd26dd39ef0e7b51cdf6b35e6ec45","amp;dn":"Riddles+of+Existence+-+A+Guided+Tour+of+Metaphysics+-2nd+Ed+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55df22d4babfd26dd39ef0e7b51cdf6b35e6ec45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,223,34,212,186,191,210,109,211,158,240,231,181,28,223,107,53,230,236,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
