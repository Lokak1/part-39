Comfortably Numb\r\n\r\nRecorder notes:\r\nThis was supposed to be the &quot;grand debut&quot; of my new recording setup. I custom-built a set of microphones using high-grade electret mics, coaxial cable, etc, and a battery box to go along with it. I went with the mics safety-pinned inside my collar. However, I messed up: the gain on my recorder is way too hot and the recording is marred with so much digital clipping that it's hardly listenable. Didn't catch that during my limiting testing (I only finished building the battery box the morning of the concert.) F**k. Back to the drawing board.\r\n\r\nSince this was the first time I was to use the new mics, and I didn't want to risk missing catching this show, I had a Zoom H1 recorder running as a backup. This is that backup. Unfortunatly, because the people in front of me couldn't decide to sit or stand (you can hear a &quot;sit the f**k down!&quot; from some of the people nearby) there was some shuffling and the recorder got knocked around a tiny bit during the first two songs. Aside from that, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. \r\n\r\nThis was my first time seeing any member of Pink Floyd perform.  :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fafd906443c6925a3d45ed674798d2beb1fb23a","amp;dn":"David+Gilmour+-+2016-03-31+-+Air+Canada+Centre%2C+Toronto%2C+ON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fafd906443c6925a3d45ed674798d2beb1fb23a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,175,217,6,68,60,105,37,163,212,94,214,116,121,141,43,235,31,178,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
