With its tender yet powerful\npiano play, deep, pounding bass and angelic melody, 'Serenity' has\nearned a place in the hearts of many Armin fans. So to touch it 7 years\nlater, you're going to have to come up with something good. Luckily,\nthat mission is in safe hands of these producer talents.\n\nAndrew Rayel, without doubt the fastest rising producer in trance land\nat the moment, shows the reason why he's also one of the most requested\nremixers. He fulfills his duties and brings out the silver lining in\n'Serenity'. He accentuates the melody, piano and gives the anthem\n\na real push towards peak-time. UK's Bryan Kearney makes 'Serenity'\nbreath uplifting, with an oldskool high-BPM and everything in place for\nfull impact. Russian duo Eximinds provide an original take on\n'Serenity', focusing on the deeper edge of progressive trance. It's\nmajestic, intriguing and absolutely big-room!&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de7e540262356d201b606f6750b79ff514cf3ee2","amp;dn":"Armin+Van+Buuren+Feat.+Jan+Vayne+-+Serenity+%28Remixes%29+Singles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de7e540262356d201b606f6750b79ff514cf3ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,126,84,2,98,53,109,32,27,96,111,103,80,183,159,245,20,207,62,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
