Much more akin to films like &quot;Versus&quot; than &quot;The Five Deadly Venoms,&quot; this film has everything but the proverbial kitchen sink thrown into it.\n On the surface it's a pretty standard revenge film - father gets murdered, son goes on rampage - but that is only the skeleton on which the true substance of this crazy, horror, kung fu fest takes flesh.\n Wild kung fu/wire fu fights, demonic vampire child acrobats, flying blood sucking skulls, the devil, a guillotine, a whore with a heart of gold, exploding bodies, romance, intrigue, sacrifice, tests of loyalty, betrayal, forgiveness, an exorcism, and even a moral - you should never kill anyone...unless they're really bad, and even then don't do it with powers you got from making a deal with the devil - all go into making this film the treat that it is.\n\nThis movie has the Shaw Brothers logo all over the DVD case, but the movie is not a Shaw Brothers production. There is no Shaw introduction fanfare, and there is no Shaw logo on the end credits.\n  This movie was made by the Chang He Film Company in Hong Kong. The distribution company that released this DVD movie &quot;Ground Zero&quot; is a bootleg company that releases bootleg quality versions of films that are sometimes out of print. That is why the quality of the DVD is so bad and unprofessional.\n I understood this when I bought the film because it is rare and out of print film, but Ground Zero crossed the line with all the false advertising on the DVD case. They claim this is a &quot;Venom's Film&quot;, while there is only 2 original Venom's in the movie, and the others new Venom's are kind of just imposters. \n  This film was directed by legendary director Chang Cheh, and it was filmed towards the end of his career as well as the whole martial arts genre craze. The movie is in full screen so it cuts off some fight scenes, the dub is bad, and I'm not even sure if it is the original dub. If you are into long lost cult fantasy Kung Fu flicks, and need to juice up the collection with rare films then 9 Demons is fun regardless of the poor bootleg quality of the film.\n I hope this movie will get a proper release one day, all Chang Cheh films deserve it. \nIf, like me, you love your kung fu movies for more than just the fighting...if you like them just a bit over the top (or a lot over the top)...and if you aren't a kung fu snob, then this movie is for you! \n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Sept%202014/TheNineDemons1984x264DVDripShawBrosKungFump4_thumbs_20140929_025617_zps1cf4a8c0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Sept%202014/TheNineDemons1984x264DVDripShawBrosKungFump4_thumbs_20140929_025617_zps1cf4a8c0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
