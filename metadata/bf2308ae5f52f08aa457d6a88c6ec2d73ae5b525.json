Lelieveld et al. (WP, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-84569-058-8\r\n\r\nPulsed electric field (PEF) food processing is a novel, non-thermal preservation method that has the potential to produce foods with excellent sensory and nutritional quality and shelf-life. This important book reviews the current status of the technology, from research into product safety and technology development to issues associated with its commercial implementation.\r\n\r\nIntroductory chapters provide an overview of the process and its history. Part one then discusses the technology of PEF food preservation, with chapters on circuitry and pulse shapes, chamber design and technical and safety requirements. The second part of the book focuses on important product safety and quality issues such as probable mechanisms of microbial inactivation by PEF, adaptation potential of microorganisms treated by this method, toxicological aspects, the impact on food enzymes and shelf life. Chapters in the final part of the book cover topics relating to the commercialisation of the technology, including current and future applications, pitfalls, economic issues and scaling up, and public and regulatory acceptance.\r\n\r\nFood preservation by pulsed electric fields is a standard reference for all those involved in research into PEF food processing and its commercialisation.\r\n\r\nReviews the current status of PEF technology with an overview of the process and its history\r\nDiscusses the technology involved in PEF food preservation\r\nFocuses on important product safety and quality issues such as the impact on food enzymes and shelf life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf2308ae5f52f08aa457d6a88c6ec2d73ae5b525","amp;dn":"Food+Preservation+by+Pulsed+Electric+Fields","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf2308ae5f52f08aa457d6a88c6ec2d73ae5b525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,35,8,174,95,82,240,138,164,87,214,168,140,110,194,215,58,229,181,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
