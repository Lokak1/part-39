The teaching staff was struck by the paradox of students on the one hand spending a week discussing healing, in terms of forgiveness and undoing separation, and on the other, fervently practicing judgment and condemnation of each other, directly opposite to the kind, gentle tone of Jesus' words in A Course in Miracles. This talk thus was devoted to the kindness of healing, in hopes of reinforcing Jesus' message of undoing separation. Kindness reflects our inherent oneness with each other, while attack drives us still further apart in our awareness. In reviewing the principles of sickness and healing and some common misapplications, the discussion in this book helps us undo the sources of unkindness, so that in all our interactions we would reflect the Source of kindness. It is hoped that this little book will serve to remind us all of the need to be kind, the spiritual principle par excellence.\n\n&quot;Kindness created me kind.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff1334ee4a268f8e1c8e01b9f3b9ea9b54826b7a","amp;dn":"The+Healing+Power+of+Kindness+--Volume+1_+Releasing+Judgment+%2821","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff1334ee4a268f8e1c8e01b9f3b9ea9b54826b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,19,52,238,74,38,143,142,28,142,1,185,243,185,234,155,84,130,107,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
