Unlike most other Cure songs of this era, the song was unexpectedly guitar-oriented, featuring no synthesizers. Upon release as a single, &quot;Never Enough&quot; topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for three weeks. On the album, it is subtitled &quot;Big Mix&quot;.\n\nAlthough Perry Bamonte is on the single cover and appears in the music video, he does not have a songwriting credit (as do the other four members) nor does he play on the track.\n\nThe song was re-recorded using acoustic guitars for 2001's Acoustic Hits album (contains re-recordings of songs by the band, and released as a bonus disc to Greatest Hits). The version featured is probably more notable than any other re-recording on the album because it is the only recording from the album released elsewhere, on 2010's various artists album Brit Awards 2010.\n\nCD and Cassette Track Listing:\n\n&quot;Never Enough&quot; (Big Mix)\n&quot;Harold &amp; Joe&quot;\n&quot;Let's Go to Bed&quot; (Milk Mix)\n&quot;Never Enough&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a02df1bcf7e716aa54e35316fde577a627a29433","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Never+Enough+%5B1990+Maxi+Single%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a02df1bcf7e716aa54e35316fde577a627a29433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,45,241,188,247,231,22,170,84,227,83,22,253,229,119,166,39,162,148,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
